<h1>Our Process</h1>
We have a clearly-defined process of mutual evaluation. We are also very flexible on this process; the end goal is to make sure that you receive all the information you need to make an informed decision about an investment. At a high level, the process is:
<ol>
<li><h2>Brand Overview</h2>
When you first inquire about a P3 Cost Analysis franchise, we will send you an initial email overview of the brand and a link to schedule a call with one of our staff. On that first Brand Overview call, you'll spend about 45 minutes getting to know our brand, and us learning about you.</li>
<li><h2>Question and Answer Session</h2>
After the Brand Overview call, we'll provide you additional information through email as well as a link to schedule a Q&A call. We want to make sure any high-level questions that you have at this point are answered. We send you our Franchise Disclosure Document at the end of this call.
</li>
<li><h2>FDD Review</h2>
Step through the Franchise Disclosure Document with your
development professional, address any questions, concerns,
or points of clarity needed. 
</li>
<li><h2></h2>
</li>
<li><h2></h2>
</li></ol>
So that's our process; and it all starts by inquiring to learn more.
