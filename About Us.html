      <h1>About Us </h1>
      <h2>People Planet And Profit </h2>
      <p>P3 was founded in 2004 with the mission of helping people while helping the planet and maximizing profitability for our clients and our own business. Our founder has been in this industry since he was 22 years old. His very first employee is still with our organization today and is in fact a partner. P3 Cost Analysts has, since our inception, valued long term relationships.
This mentality naturally lends itself to the franchise community; we focus on franchisee profitability knowing that our own success will be a natural outcome of yours.

      <h2>A One-of-a-Kind Opportunity</h2>
      <p>Our opportunity is truly unique. We offer a home based, business to business, executive professional franchise with significantly high earning potential and a very low investment.
This industry is not for everybody. Our franchisees must be truly self-motivated, not afraid to engage with business owners in their community and be driven by equal parts of a desire to succeed in a desire to help others. Learn more about our ideal franchisee here.

            <h2>Unmatched Expertise and Guidance</h2>
      <p>The adage of franchising, in business for yourself but not by yourself, is personified in our offering. Our franchisees receive not only initial and ongoing training and support in their business, but also received the benefits of our fully staffed on experts to handle the back end of their business.
