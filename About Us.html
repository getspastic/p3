      <h2>People Planet And Profit </h2>
      <p>P3 was founded in 2004 with the mission of helping people while helping the planet and maximizing profitability for our clients and our own business. Our founder has been in this industry since he was 22 years old. His very first employee is still with our organization today and is in fact a partner. P3 Cost Analysts has, since our inception, valued long term relationships.
This mentality naturally lends itself to the franchise community; we focus on franchisee profitability knowing that our own success will be a natural outcome of yours.

      <h2>A One-of-a-Kind Business to Business Franchise</h2>

We provide a home-based, executive professional franchise with the potential for substantial earnings and a minimal investment requirement.
