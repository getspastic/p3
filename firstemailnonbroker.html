I imagine you are eager to learn more about our business, and I would love to get on a call with you soon. However, I also would like to share some fundamental information with you regarding the <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#224899;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">P3</span> model in advance of us connecting. <a href="https://youtu.be/NhXFKKd-m7Y?si=5XzewmJ1I2rU7EeU">This short, 3 minute video</a> will help you understand the basics of our model. 
                This should allow our time together to be more productive, and hopefully by the end of our first call you’ll have a clear picture, from a high level, of exactly what it is that a P3 franchisee does!<br/>
As you can see, the <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#224899;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">P3 Cost</span> <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#78A1D4;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Analysts</span> brand is very distinctive. We are fortunate in that we are able to offer a service that is paid for directly out of the savings we are able to secure for our clients.<br/> There are many things that make the P3 franchise unique. Among them are:
<ul>
 <li><strong>Reoccurring revenue.</strong> We are often able to continue to save our clients’ money month after month, year after year. Again, it is in that savings that our profitability lies. 
</li>
 <li><strong>We do the heavy lifting.</strong> Don’t get me wrong, our franchisees definitely work hard and are dedicated to their businesses. But it is the P3 franchisor team that does all the intial auditing, finds the savings for the potential client, and helps to nurture and maintain that relationship on your behalf year after year.
 </li>
 <li>
<strong>Exceptionally low investment.</strong> Rarely do you see a franchise that has such a strong earning potential and the trappings of an executive B2B business with top-of-range investment less that $80,000 including working capital! 
 </li></ul>

We pride ourselves in providing world class training and support to our franchisees. The ongoing support is something we’ll dig into when we connect, but I wanted to set expectations for our initial training. <br/>
<ol>
        <li>
There’s an old saying; ‘those who can, do. Those who can’t, teach.’ Nothing could be farther from the truth at P3. Our franchisees receive intensive business management, prospecting, pipeline-maintenance, and sales training from individuals who have actually built successful <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#224899;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">P3 Cost</span> <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#78A1D4;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Analysts</span> businesses. Training inlcudes
</li><li>
Business Setup. From day one you will begin to experience our collaberative culture. We will work with you from initially  getting your LLC (or C or S corp) established, your business entity established for the business including your  federal tax ID number, and if you need it, we’ll even assist in the minutia; business banking account, insurance, and all the ‘little’ things that become big things if they are not done correctly. 
</li><li>
Client Engagement. As the heart of our business, helping our franchisees perfect their engagement model is something we pride ourselves in. From how to get in front of the decision makers, to cadenced voice mails, prepared drip emails, and even ‘ice-breaker’ scripts when you do get the right person on the phone. As an aside, this isn’t ‘set it and forget it’; the same person who trains you on client engagement will work with you as you build your business until these steps become truly second nature.

As a franchisor we have several responsibilities that we take very seriously. First, we only want to invite folks to join the <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#224899;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">P3 Cost</span> <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#78A1D4;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">Analysts</span> brand that we truly believe will thrive in our culture. Secondly, we guard our franchisees' time jealsoully; engaging with prospective candidates is something that we do ask them to do, and they are very generous with their time because they know that we only introduce them to folks who have had serious discussions with us, first. Finally, we value <strong>your</strong> time. Of course, many of our selection criteria cannot be quantified over a single email; however there are a few minimum checks you can ask yourself right now to see if this is the right time to pursue a <span style="font-size:14px; font-family:Trebuchet MS,Helvetica,sans-serif; white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;color:#224899;background-color:transparent;font-weight:700;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">P3</span> franchise.
<ol>
<li>Do you have direct access to a minimum of $50K without taking a loan (cash, easily liquidated assets, etc.), and a minimum net worth (combined if a partnership) of $100K?
</li><li>Does at least one of the partners in the potential venture have the desire to be dedicated full time to the building of the business?
</li><li>Can all partners pass a criminal background check?
</li><li>Are you considering making a business decision within the next 6 months?</li></ol>

 

If you can answer yes to these four questions, we should most certainly have an initial conversation. I would encourage you to <a href="https://calendly.com/nathan_upllc/p3-cost-analysts">use this link to schedule a call with me at your convenience</a>.<br/>

<br/>You should also feel free to reach out to me via email, phone, or even send me a text for scheduling.
I know that time can get away from us sometimes, so I will also give you a call if I haven't heard from you in the next couple of days.
I look forward to speaking with you in the very near term!
