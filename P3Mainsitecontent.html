<br /><p>Reducing costs for telecom services is quite difficult for the average customer.</p>
<br /><p>Between a lack of transparency around telecom billing tactics, and vendors frequently not billing according to their own contracts, customers tend to overpay for these services without knowing it.</p>
<br /><p>To find errors, overcharges, and breaches of contract, it takes a high level of knowledge and me that a typical customer doesn’t have. Ultimately, it takes a thorough audit by telecom industry experts to truly start cutting costs in this expense category.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a closer look at the telecom industry, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring</p>
<br /><p>to our customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The telecom industry in the modern age provides wired and mobile phone services, Internet services, and a variety of other data transmission services. Previously, when there were only a few vendors servicing the market, telecom was more regulated than it is today. Once more and more vendors came to the market, the government decided to make it a completely open market, letting companies compete and set their pricing.</p>
<br /><p>Though telecom is an open market, vendors must still outline tariffs that exist as an agreement between themselves, regulating bodies, and customers as to how much they charge for their services. Vendors are no longer required to file their tariffs with the FCC, but many still choose to do so. Others file them with state-level utility commissions and also publish them on their websites.</p>
<br /><p>While there is regulator on in the telecom industry via the Federal Communications Commission, vendors tend to keep their billing tactics as secret as possible. They don’t want customers questioning their bills and therefore don’t release certain billing information unless a customer specifically calls in and requests it. The issue is, even if a customer requests more details about their bill, they o en won’t be able to understand the complex language or figure out if they are actually being overcharged.</p>
<br /><p>Another issue is that customers simply don’t know what they don’t know. They think their IT or billing department is checking to make sure they are getting the best price, but these in-house employees rarely have the knowledge and industry expertise required to optimize spending on telecom services. Their expert se lies in keeping the technology running, rather than figuring out if they are being billed accurately and at the most efficient cost.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Below are the key areas of telecom billing that P3 Cost Analysts audits in order to discover errors, overcharges, and other areas of dispute.</p>
<br /><p>A customer service record is a very detailed report of what telecom services a customer uses, what rates they’re charged at, and how these rates are calculated. Anyone can request these records but many customers don’t even know they exist. Even if a customer does request these records, they won’t be able to understand them because they are written in a computer-generated code that only a trained expert would understand. It would even be difficult for a finance director or CFO to understand these documents.</p>
<br /><p>Here’s an example of what a portion of a CSR looks like:</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>At P3 we have trained experts who know how to read these documents and find errors or overcharges. Within these customer service records we look for:</p>
<br /><p>Another key way in which we find savings is by comparing the customer service records described above with a vendor's outlined tariffs to make sure the vendor is actually following their pricing guidelines.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, finding these tariffs can be difficult. Luckily, at P3 we know how to access these documents in order to compare them to a customer’s CSR.</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, vendors aren’t following their pricing guidelines and at other times they’re simply misapplying tariffs. Both of which we can verify and correct if needed.</p>
<br /><p>You would be amazed by how many telecom vendors don’t bill according to their contracts. In many cases, discrepancies with contracts revolve around discounts not being applied to the customer’s account properly.</p>
<br /><p>Here are some examples:</p>
<br /><p>P3 can also help clients enroll in new contracts. Some times a client’s contract has expired and they fall under casual rates without knowing it. These rates are much much higher than contract rates and we help customers get back into a fair contract as quickly as possible.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The key reason we audit terms and conditions is to find out how far back we can look for disputes and what kind of credits can be reapplied to a client’s account. In a lot of cases, when we open a dispute from a while ago, the vendor will just try to issue a customary three- to six-month credit instead of the full amount. We’ve been in the industry long enough to know that we don’t have to accept this offer.</p>
<br /><p>We are able to understand the language outlined in the terms and conditions in order to bring our clients the refund they deserve based on when the actual error occurred. Vendors typically comply with our requests so that the FCC doesn’t need to get involved, but there have been rare instances where we have taken a dispute to the FCC.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather customer service records, pull tariffs, and request contracts from the telecom companies. In most cases, gathering this info can take 5–10 days, or even up to a month with some vendors.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we apply decades of expertise in this industry to review and compare contracts, customer service records, and tariffs, searching for errors and overcharges. We also run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4–6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our findings and recommendations in a savings letter. The client can then authorize us to move forward with negotiating with the telecom vendors.</p>
<br /><p>Once our findings are approved, we work with the vendor to secure new agreements, resolve disputes, and set up the most cost-efficient telecom programs.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure that savings stay intact and vendors honor their agreements and pricing. We have found vendors are constantly violating their own agreements and we monitor and fight off unwarranted price increases and overcharges on our client's behalf. Furthermore, we monitor market conditions and look for ways to keep costs down or drive them lower.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>P3 averages finding clients savings of 15-30% on their telecom expenses. Below are some examples of work we’ve done for our clients.</p>
<br /><p>With this particular school system, the client was paying great rates for all of their telecom services. Most other aspects of the audit confirmed that there were no overcharges or opportunities for savings. However, the client did have a PRI that was being billed incorrectly. They also had associated taxes and fees that were being overbilled. The vendor had simply misentered the allowable charges (per the tariff) on the client’s account. It had been billed in error for 14 years. We identified this error and began working to have it fixed by the vendor. Countless employees at the vendor would not acknowledge this was indeed an error. They did not understand their own tariff and believed it to be billed correctly. After finally finding someone at the vendor who agreed it was an error, they offered a 3-month refund of the overcharge, claiming that was all they were legally required to refund. We knew this was not true.</p>
<br /><p>We knew with this particular type of error the client should have it refunded back to the point of error.</p>
<br /><p>After many more calls with the vendor, and even seeing this escalated up to the CFO of the vendor company, our client received a $150,000 refund check in the mail and saw their bill reduced by over $3,000/month.</p>
<br /><p>A city was charged for about 50 business lines on a consolidated bill and individual contracts and the business lines were not under contract with a particular vendor. As a result, the city was charged very high rates for the business lines. P3 Cost Analysts worked with the telecom vendor to negotiate lower rates for the business lines. Once the business lines were placed under contract, P3 Cost Analysts were able to reduce the charges by $5,100 per month.</p>
<br /><p>The wireless accounts for a company were not receiving any discounts. P3 Cost Analysts negotiated with the wireless carrier and applied discounts to the wireless accounts. By adding the discounts, P3 Cost Analysts were able to reduce the client’s bill by $1,000 per month.</p>

<br /><p>The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) was created by the CARES ACT of 2020 to provide relief to businesses who were adversely affected by the Coronavirus Pandemic. This $370 Billion stimulus package provides funding to small businesses who retained their employees during the crisis. The ERC was improved and extended by both the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 and the Covid-19 Relief Package of 2021. While the legislation has changed multiple times the current law allows businesses who experienced a significant reduction in revenue during Covid to qualify, as well as businesses who faced some sort of full or partial restrictions on their business.  Our team assists in determining eligibility for the ERC and does all of the relevant calculations and filings to help our clients maximize the amount of funding available. </p>
<br /><p>For 2020, the ERC provides a fully refundable credit of up to $5,000 per employee for businesses with 100 employees or less. Employers with between 101 and 500 employees can still qualify for the credit, but only on wages paid to employees NOT to work.</p>
<br /><p>For 2021, the ERC provides a fully refundable credit of up to $7,000 per employee for each qualifying quarter in 2021, and the employee count threshold was increased from 100 to 500. The credit is currently available for the first three quarters of 2021. In total, an employer can receive up to $26,000 ($5,000 + $7,000 + $7,000 + $7,000) per employee for the years 2020 and 2021.</p>
<br /><p>Businesses with less than 100 employees in 2020 and/or less than 500 employees in</p>
<br /><p>2021 must meet one of the two requirements below to qualify for ERC.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>1. Curtailment of Operations</p>
<br /><p>Full or partial suspension of business operations as a result of government order, OR;</p>
<br /><p>2. Significant Decline in Gross Receipts</p>
<br /><p>2020 - Decline in gross receipts defined as 50% or greater than their gross receipts in the same quarter of 2019.</p>
<br /><p>2021 - Decline in gross receipts defined as 20% or greater than their gross receipts in the same quarter of 2019.</p>
<br /><p>Beginning January 1, 2021 and through December 31, 2021, employers who received PPP loans may still qualify for the ERC with respect to wages that are not paid for with forgiven PPP proceeds retroactive to the CARES ACT. In addition, not-for-profit organizations may also qualify for the ERC credit.</p>
<br /><p>Obtaining the credit</p>
<br /><p>Our tax professionals will review the relevant financial records to calculate the dollar amount of the eligible employer's expected credit. Our team will then complete and file the relevant IRS forms for the employer and retain all the necessary documentation.</p>
<br /><p>Zero out-of-pocket Costs</p>
<br /><p>We do not charge an upfront fee for this service. Financial compensation to our tax team only occurs after the eligible employer receives their credit, which will be issued as a check.</p>

<br /><p>Between waste vendors’ confusing contractual language and customers not knowing which charges are valid, companies all across the country overpay for waste and recycling without realizing it.</p>
<br /><p>To find the applicable overcharges and invalid fees to reduce your business's surcharge, you need a trained eye. More specifically, you need professionals whose core competency is waste and recycling auditing and billing to thoroughly understand where your business is overpaying.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a look at how the waste and recycling industry prices their services, the valid and invalid reasons for fees and changes in billing, and how the P3 Cost Analysts’ Waste Management auditing solution finds real savings for customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>What makes the $40+ billion waste and recycling industry so complex is that there’s rarely set pricing for the services they sell. Sales reps have incentives for selling services at higher prices, which leads to differences in what customers pay depending on their rep. In many cases, people will pay vastly different prices for the same service depending on whether they negotiate using key benchmark data or simply accept their representative's offer.</p>
<br /><p>Even if you sign a contract that you’re happy with at the outset, this price can completely change three, six, or nine months down the line. In most cases, these contracts are three years long. Many of these contracts also have an auto-renewal clause, and if you’re not paying attention, you could get roped into another three years without realizing it.</p>
<br /><p>There are two types of markets for waste: Open Markets and Franchised Markets.</p>
<br /><p>In franchised markets, the government has negotiated the prices for business owners in that city or community and contracted with a private waste hauler. The pricing is set by the government. Governments typically negotiate free services for government facilities in exchange for the private hauler receiving the monopoly rights to service the businesses in that community.</p>
<br /><p>Unfortunately, these deals o en result in businesses paying well above market rates for their waste and recycling services. The governments negotiating these agreements are not experts in the waste and recycling industry, and, in our experience, the costs passed on to businesses are almost always higher than open market rates.</p>
<br /><p>While businesses cannot negotiate a lower price in these markets, there are o en savings to be found due to errors and overcharges, haulers not following the franchise agreement, or options to use alternative and more efficient equipment (like compactors, balers, or other types of dumpsters) in these markets.</p>
<br /><p>Open markets comprise the vast majority in the United States. In these markets, the government has let the choice of waste hauler up to the individual business. With this freedom of choice, however, comes responsibility.</p>
<br /><p>Since there’s limited regulation within the waste management industry, vendors can structure their contracts and invoicing to solely benefit themselves. The contract language they use typically allows them to tack on additional fees for whatever reasons they want. Additionally, there’s no effective way to file a formal complaint about these contracts or any unexpected surcharges. Businesses must ‘vote with their feet’ and change haulers - or negotiate themselves to have an impact. However, the complexity of hauler agreements can make it seem impossible to make changes.</p>
<br /><p>Furthermore, each waste market is vastly different. A waste market even one county away could have drastically different pricing depending on the landfill location, local regulations, and a myriad of other pricing concerns. The only way to truly know whether it’s a good deal is to have benchmark pricing data from customer locations all over the country.</p>
<br /><p>So, while open markets can result in better pricing for businesses, they only do so if they are negotiated and handled correctly, and by experts in the industry.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, deciphering these charges and understanding the contractual language is almost impossible. Waste and recycling companies know this and are good at making certain fees sound mandatory when, in fact, they are not. Many customers just accept the charges or assume waste and recycling fees are fixed like other business costs. Without experience and proper market information, they lack the negotiating power and simply tend to accept the waste company's charges at face value.</p>
<br /><p>Luckily, there are steps businesses can take to avoid unnecessary fees and overcharges. The most impactful thing they can do is work through a full waste audit led by a professional team. At P3 Cost Analysts, we are experts in the waste and recycling industry, have over 30,000 client benchmark data points across the country, and know exactly what to look for in regards to valid and invalid charges.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In many cases, the fee increases you see are valid and usually aren’t a cause for concern. However, even valid fee increases can be misapplied and the overall cost burden placed on the customer. Generally speaking, you can expect a standard price increase of 15% per year if you sign a contract as is and don’t take any additional steps - and that is with current inflation rates, which fall at around 3%. As inflation increases you can expect the price increases from haulers to reach an even higher rate.</p>
<br /><p>Fee Increases and Additional Charges</p>
<br /><p>Government Regulation Changes</p>
<br /><p>Some coun es and ci es have franchise fees for haulers to be able to operate there. These fees then get passed on to customers.</p>
<br /><p>Landfill Price Increases</p>
<br /><p>These happen when landfills, both privately and publicly owned, increase charges and these are passed through to the haulers, who then pass them on to customers.</p>
<br /><p>Labor Cost Increase</p>
<br /><p>When employees get paid more, customers will also pay more. Minimum wage and local labor market conditions all factor into the price of your waste and recycling expenses.</p>
<br /><p>Fuel Cost Increase</p>
<br /><p>As fuel prices rise, waste and recycling companies need a way to offset these additional fees.</p>
<br /><p>While these are legitimate reasons for rising costs, the level increased is not always valid.</p>
<br /><p>Examples</p>
<br /><p>Waste and recycling companies will use legitimate regulations to increase your costs more than their costs have gone up.</p>
<br /><p>Or</p>
<br /><p>The calculation of the cost increase is an internal proprietary process, so you’ll never really know how they arrived at their new number.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Valid increases are expected to some extent, but there are many invalid reasons waste and recycling companies increase fees or overcharge. Unfortunately, they can raise pricing for any reason they want. These fees haven’t always existed, and the waste management companies seem to keep inventing new fees as the years go on. Most of the fees and overcharges are intentional and a profit motive that, left unchecked, can get out of control.</p>
<br /><p>Fuel Fees</p>
<br /><p>There’s no way to accurately calculate how much fuel companies in the waste industry actually use. Fifteen years ago, there was no fuel fee because it was included in the base rate. When the fuel market exploded about a decade ago, some waste companies’ fuel fees went up 25%+, but then when the fuel market tanked, their fuel charges never went back down, or only dropped by a small percentage.</p>
<br /><p>Recyclable Material Offset Charge</p>
<br /><p>This vague fee is an additional fee o en seen for customers that have a recycling service.</p>
<br /><p>Overflow Fees</p>
<br /><p>This fee is added if your lid is propped open too high, even if you have only something small hanging out under the lid. Trucks now have cameras that can take photo evidence of overflows. They’ll even charge you if they are a day late and your bin is overflowing because of it. The problem is not so much the existence of this fee, but the cost and the subjective manner in which it is applied.</p>
<br /><p>Example</p>
<br /><p>If you have an $80/month trash bill and the waste company charges you a $120 overflow fee for having your lid propped open one inch, that’s illegitimate and unnecessary.</p>
<br /><p>Container Maintenance Fees</p>
<br /><p>This is a monthly fee to keep your trash container looking good and acts like a type of insurance for your container. But since the waste company owns the container, this is essentially pointless for the customer. This fee was created by many of the larger haulers over the past few years.</p>
<br /><p>Extra Pickup Charges</p>
<br /><p>If a customer has a busy week, they may need an additional waste pickup. Though some sort of charge is reasonable, the waste companies tend to drastically overcharge these extra pickups. This is because the waste companies’ contracts generally allow them to charge what they want.</p>
<br /><p>Exchange, Removal, and Delivery Fees</p>
<br /><p>If you get a leaky dumpster or need to upgrade to a different size, you’ll likely incur an exchange fee. But what sometimes happens is they’ll charge you for an exchange but also tack on a removal and delivery fee. In reality, the exchange fee is just removal + delivery so being charged for all three is unnecessary.</p>
<br /><p>Overhauling</p>
<br /><p>Some companies will haul waste and recycling to a landfill much farther than they have to go, thus incurring more hauling charges for the customer. This could be because they own the landfill further away and have better margins there, or just want to be able to charge higher haul (distance) rates. Knowing the landscape of the local landfills and your options is paramount to keeping your waste expenses under control.</p>
<br /><p>Misclassification of Waste</p>
<br /><p>Sometimes people may have "regular" waste, yet the vendor classifies it as a liquid or hazardous waste. Whether their classification is valid or not, this means they have to take it to a different part of the landfill where it’s put into a different place than where normal waste goes, incurring an additional charge.</p>
<br /><p>Contamination for Recycling</p>
<br /><p>If you put your recycling in a plastic bag (which is not recyclable), they can charge you $150 for contamination.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>At P3 Cost Analysts, we have staff who have worked in this industry for decades and know all the intricacies around pricing and contracts. We know the regional minimum amounts that waste and recycling companies will agree to, and we fight to get these prices for our clients.</p>
<br /><p>The best part is our clients don’t pay a cent un l we find savings. From there we share in the savings 50/50 each month.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Example 1</p>
<br /><p>We had a client who was in a franchise market which meant they could only work with one waste industry vendor. For this reason, we weren’t able to go through our typical contract negotiation but were able to find savings in other ways.</p>
<br /><p>Our experts recognized that the waste loads the vendor was hauling were much lighter than they should’ve been in comparison to our known standards for the equipment the client was using. We conducted a site visit for the client and realized their waste compactor was not functioning properly. It was only compacting the trash to 1⁄3 of the normal opera ng range for that piece of equipment, which caused the compactor to show it was full before it actually was.</p>
<br /><p>We were then able to get the equipment fixed, thus increasing the waste loads they were sending each trip by 2.5x. This, in turn, reduced the number of times our client needed their waste vendor to make trips to the landfill.</p>
<br /><p>This improvement ended up saving our client about $20K/year.</p>
<br /><p>Example 2</p>
<br /><p>Our client had 70 locations in the fast-food industry with different waste contracts for each location. About 80% of the locations were already recycling cardboard, but some were not. And the ones that were, were not doing so efficiently.</p>
<br /><p>We decided to set up recycling for cardboard at several locations and reduced the amount of cardboard going to the landfill, thereby making them more green.</p>
<br /><p>This new recycling program generated a couple thousand dollars in savings alone.</p>
<br /><p>We also renegotiated their contracts to get them the lowest price they deserved. All in all, these re-negotiated contracts and other implementations saved the client over $200,000/year.</p>
<br /><p>Example 3</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a medical company that regularly had hazardous materials to dispose of. If there’s a significant amount of blood on something, it has to be hauled away in special bags and containers.</p>
<br /><p>The medical waste portion of the industry is dominated by a couple of vendors, so they’re very aggressive with their pricing tactics.</p>
<br /><p>This particular client was an ophthalmology clinic paying $3,000/month for one box of medical waste hauled off a week. We were able to get their cost down to $300/month (90% reduction), and this was just the initial savings.</p>
<br /><p>Over the long term, we were able to get them to a price point of around $75/month. These savings were generated by leveraging our expertise around benchmarks from what others around the region were paying.</p>
<br /><p>Example 4</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a medium-sized industrial client in California, which happens to be a highly regulated market.</p>
<br /><p>In this case, we were able to reduce their weight cost as well as their base cost.</p>
<br /><p>This was accomplished by removing a series of minimum charges their vendor was applying. Instead of paying a full 5-ton fee per pickup (even when they had much less), they now are charged for an amount much closer to the actual weight of the waste they dispose of.</p>
<br /><p>In total, this client was able to save around $2,000 per month due to our implementations.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Without understanding the work we do, a lot of people think there’s just nothing P3 can do to help them or that our service is “too good to be true.” Our response is “why not give it a shot?”</p>
<br /><p>If we can’t help our clients, then it costs them nothing. But if we do find areas of improvement, they can greatly increase their savings. In more cases than not, there are opportunities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re more than a mom-and-pop type business, the only way you can effectively save on waste and recycling costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the waste and recycling industry, or you need to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>If you’ve ever been confused about the billing and pricing variables from your uniform and linen provider, you’re not alone.</p>
<br /><p>Between rates that constantly change, and providers using aggressive pricing tactics, businesses everywhere are being overcharged for their uniform and linen services.</p>
<br /><p>In order to understand where you’re being overcharged and to negotiate better rates, it takes expert-level knowledge in this industry. It also takes me and resources that many businesses simply don’t have.</p>
<br /><p>To gain a better understanding of how you can start saving costs on uniform and linen services, let’s take a closer look at how these services are priced, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The uniform and linen industry is largely monopolized by three national uniform providers and one linen provider. Though there are a few smaller local or regional players, most businesses will have to work with the larger providers.</p>
<br /><p>These major providers include:</p>
<br /><p>Since these major providers essentially have a monopoly on the industry, they engage in aggressive pricing tactics and constantly change billing variables to serve their needs and not the customers. Furthermore, there are no uniform billing practices between these providers and they each use their own contract verbiage, which is extremely one-sided in the vendor’s favor. This means you can expect prices to change throughout your contract, often with no recourse.</p>
<br /><p>It’s important to remember that since uniforms and linens are rented, charges are not a one-and-done transaction. There are many variables in play that you’re responsible for on an ongoing basis.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, it’s important to note that route drivers for these providers are paid based on a percentage of invoices and also by hitting certain KPIs. Bonuses get paid out due to revenue-enhancing metrics such as loss charge revenue, meaning there’s no incentive for them to correct any billing errors.</p>
<br /><p>Here’s an overview of some of these variables:</p>
<br /><p>In most cases, linen and uniform providers are breaching their own contracts and overcharging without valid explanations. It’s common to see costs increase 2-3x the rate of inflation and customers getting 5-10 % annual price increases (at current rates of inflation, 2-3% at the time of writing). Without having your core competency in the uniform and linen industry, customers won’t know what to look for or how to dispute these surcharges.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>To start our engagement with clients, we need a signed service agreement and letter of authorization to obtain the info we need from suppliers. We also need your current uniform and linen service agreement, as well as the last 4 weeks of relevant invoices.</p>
<br /><p>It will take us 2-3 weeks to work through a full audit of your invoices and to report our initial findings.</p>
<br /><p>During this me, we will look at contract compliance and dive into each of the pricing variables, looking for errors and overcharges. We typically review over 50 different pricing and term variables on every uniform and linen agreement.</p>
<br /><p>With our industry expertise, we are able to see what you are being charged in relation to nationwide standards and alternative product or service solutions. Typically, we are able to find an average of 35% in savings.</p>
<br /><p>Once we’ve compiled our findings, we will have a 20- to 30-minute call with our clients to discuss a negotiation strategy, then get to work renegotiating their contracts. We leverage our national database of vendor benchmarks, and inside knowledge of the vendors (having worked for them in the past), to drive savings for our clients. We typically stay with the incumbent vendor unless our clients have had issues with them in the past and are wanting to change.</p>
<br /><p>Alongside negotiating better terms for our clients, we will receive refunds or rebates for past overcharges 30-40% of the time. This largely depends on the previous contractual language and if addendums or special terms and conditions were added.</p>
<br /><p>Knowing how to find the savings and how to negotiate them is one thing, but in this industry, the vendors are constantly getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar.</p>
<br /><p>Even with a properly negotiated contract and properly negotiated terms and conditions, providers will find ways to increase these costs, in violation of their own agreed-upon contract.</p>
<br /><p>Further complicating things is the fact that most clients have dozens of line items being billed. It can be difficult to catch a $.02 increase on a mop handle, or towel, that violates the agreement. And even if caught, it can take a mountain of work to reach out to the vendor to have this corrected. These errors happen amongst almost all providers and can add up to significant costs.</p>
<br /><p>During the Ongoing Audit phase, we monitor these expenses for our clients, making sure vendors stay compliant to their contracts - and fighting on our client’s behalf when they don’t.</p>
<br /><p>Multi-location Auto Dealership</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a growing auto dealership that had 17 different locations and was spending around $140,000 annually on uniforms, mats, towels, and other industrial laundry items. Before we started working with them, they had two different suppliers that the CFO and Fixed Ops Director were unsatisfied with due to poor communication, increased invoices, and speed of product repairs.</p>
<br /><p>P3 Cost Analysts audited every contract and invoice line item from all locations and brought these results to the auto dealership. After months of negotiations with the suppliers, we were able to:</p>
<br /><p>Large Country Club</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a Country Club that was spending over $220,000 per year for their industrial laundry services. They had one supplier for their landscaping department and one for their club and service branch. The CFO tried meeting with these vendors to understand the club’s billing but never got any straight answers.</p>
<br /><p>We came in and did a full audit of the existing contracts and invoices. Since this was a complex account, we did an onsite visit to better understand their operations. Once we had our initial findings, we started negotiating better pricing, product quality, and service guarantees.</p>
<br /><p>Through our negotiations, we were able to:</p>
<br /><p>Grocery Store Chain</p>
<br /><p>We went to work at a 26-location on grocery store chain spending over $250,000/year on laundry services. We started digging into the existing contracts and invoicing for every line item of all store locations. We discovered that the Master Agreement was not properly executed and that there were 3 different suppliers with inconsistent pricing and terms. The Master Agreement had 25 contracted items, yet there were 139 on the invoices. We compiled all of the results with projected savings for the Initial Analysis and Strategy Meeting. The client selected the strategy to move forward to achieve the best pricing, terms, and product/pricing controls.</p>
<br /><p>Results</p>
<br /><p>We reviewed all the in-service products, inventories, and store placements by store to maximize the service and cost. Successful negotiations resulted in best pricing, terms, product quality, and a dedicated National Account customer service manager.</p>
<br /><p>Our work produced 30% total savings for a total of $75,000/year.</p>
<br /><p>Many businesses have an in-house procurement team and believe that this is sufficient to avoid overcharges. But, in many cases, industrial laundry pricing is not their core competency.</p>
<br /><p>It should be noted that we are in no way trying to replace these teams, but rather we are a source of expertise to support their efforts. We often help businesses save around 30%-50% on industrial laundry services even when businesses have a procurement team.</p>
<br /><p>Working through every line item and continually reviewing invoices is very intensive and requires a great deal of me that these teams may not have. We also have the knowledge and skills required to speak with the industrial laundry providers’ upper-level management. Often, these people aren’t accessible to the original procurement team.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re more than a mom-and-pop type business, the only way you can effectively save on uniform and linen service costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or you need to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>Are you getting the best pricing from your shipping carrier? Many business owners think there couldn’t possibly be room to negotiate more savings on their carrier contracts, but you’d be surprised. Every day, we save companies just like yours 15% to 20%.</p>
<br /><p>Carrier contracts can be overly complex and difficult to understand. They contain pricing tiers with different discounts for different weights and zones, and no shortage of fine print that can change the pricing altogether. The truth is these contracts are cleverly designed by pricing analysts to be as profitable as possible.</p>
<br /><p>Our expert small parcel audit team of former FedEx, UPS, and DHL pricing analysts understand carrier contracts. They’ll perform a market analysis of your current contract and give you localized insights that will help you negotiate the best savings. With P3, you’ll have access to the most competitive pricing available in today’s marketplace.</p>
<br /><p>With our guidance, you can use the money you save on shipping to run specials like free shipping or discounts on top-selling products. Our clients have outpaced competitors and seen double-digit increases in both revenue and market share.</p>
<br /><p>Negotiate a better deal with your favorite carrier or explore a new carrier’s rates for a potential new level of savings. Either way, you’ll have more money in your pocket with zero new costs incurred. With P3, you pay nothing out of pocket. We’re only paid a share of what we actually save your business.</p>
<br /><p>On top of our negotiation expertise, we help clients get credits back from overcharges. Did you know that every year, billions of dollars in shipping refunds go unclaimed? It’s true. Out of $2 billion in parcel audit credit refunds owed by shipping carriers each year, a full 75% go unclaimed. That’s $1.5 billion!</p>
<br /><p>The fact is, if your company ships and receives packages with carriers like FedEx and UPS, you could be entitled to thousands of dollars in refunds. Every time a package arrives even just a few minutes late, you’re likely owed a refund on its shipping cost.</p>
<br /><p>On average, 3% to 5% of packages are delivered late every day. But you only have 15 days to claim your money. It isn’t just late deliveries that are the problem. Billing errors can occur on every carrier invoice you receive. The problem is that carrier invoices can be hundreds of pages long every week.</p>
<br /><p>Thankfully, there’s P3. Our team of auditors will conduct a thorough, 45-point parcel audit on each of your shipments. Our proprietary software not only gets you back all of the money you are owed, but also automates the refund process. Which means you can just sit back and watch your refund credits pile up.</p>

<br /><p>For businesses and organizations that utilize a large volume of managed print services, it’s a challenge to understand how to optimize costs.</p>
<br /><p>Between a lack of knowledge around how to analyze pricing information and how to consolidate vendor contracts, businesses everywhere are overpaying for managed print services.</p>
<br /><p>In order to understand where you’re overpaying and how to negotiate better rates, it takes expert-level knowledge in this industry. It also takes time and resources that many businesses simply don’t have.</p>
<br /><p>To gain a better understanding of how you can start saving costs on managed print services, let’s take a closer look at how these services are priced, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The managed print services industry generally comprises two types of units: printers and copiers.	Printers are the types of machines that generally reside in individual oﬃces or on desks. These machines can still be quite expensive, but they are smaller and intended mainly for individual use. Copiers, on the other hand, are the large, commercial-grade machines seen in a large oﬃce environment. These machines are shared between many users and can print hundreds of thousands of pages per month.</p>
<br /><p>In the managed print services industry, there are several major vendors. HP leads the way in regards to printers, holding around 90% of the market share. The other 10% of printers and the majority of the copier sector are controlled by Canon, Xerox, Ricoh, Konica Minolta, and Toshiba.</p>
<br /><p>When acquiring these machines and the services that accompany them, customers may work with these manufacturers directly, a regional dealer for the companies, or an independent managed print services company that represents those brands.</p>
<br /><p>As a highly competitive industry, these vendors are always looking to match or rise above the competition in regard to functionality and features. Because of this, there are very few distinguishing features between the brands, leading to a fairly level playing field for customers to choose from. Given that these machines are somewhat of a ‘commodity’ in nature, and since functionality and service are similar across the industry, the distinguishing factor for customers is cost difference.</p>
<br /><p>There are three main categories of costs when it comes to managed print services:</p>
<br /><p>Depending on the vendor, there will be variations in how these three categories are priced. It’s common for vendors to oﬀer a great rate in one category while elevating the price in another to reach their total desired price point. Typically, the customer will be attracted by the pricing in one category without understanding that they are being overcharged in the others.</p>
<br /><p>When selling managed print services, vendors also calculate a cost per page for their customers, which is a ratio between equipment/supply costs and the volume of pages produced. However, in most cases, the cost per page which is presented to customers does not factor in all the costs associated with the</p>
<br /><p>all-inclusive total cost per page. Without knowing what to look for or what to factor in when calculating this cost, it’s impossible to know if the rates are good or bad.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, the only information about pricing they receive is from the sales rep they work with. And in a lot of cases, these sales reps are given the price they can sell at without actually knowing the true costs of what they are selling. This lack of transparency within the industry as a whole leaves customers blind to know if there could be room to negotiate better rates.</p>
<br /><p>Even if the customer thinks they have a high degree of knowledge or are given the right information, it’s unlikely they will know how to analyze it properly. Furthermore, customers that may use an RFP process to gather pricing and proposals may get competing bids, but these bids are never optimized for the clients’ actual needed services or at true market rates. As a result of this, the print industry is rife with confusion and overcharges. This leads to the vast majority of customers being overcharged 30-40%. Without a nationwide database of vendor benchmarks and prior experience in the print industry, it’s impossible to know if what you are spending is accurate and cost-eﬃcient.</p>
<br /><p>A big issue for many businesses and organizations is that they have numerous machines under a variety of diﬀerent contracts. This creates ongoing problems, such as diﬀerent lease expiration dates and variations in pricing for products and services.</p>
<br /><p>When there are multiple diﬀerent price points on machines that are essentially the same, you are not only overpaying, but reconciling invoices also becomes a nightmare for your billing administrators.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In almost any industry, when you buy or lease in bulk with a singular vendor, you get much better pricing on those products. The same goes for managed print services. A key mistake we see with businesses and organizations is having their buying power split between multiple contracts and multiple vendors.</p>
<br /><p>In order to optimize spending and have uniform rates across your spending, these contracts need to be consolidated under one vendor.</p>
<br /><p>For example</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a large, well-respected university that had 500 copiers on their campus under 500 diﬀerent contracts, and worked with 15 diﬀerent vendors. Because of their status as a well-known university, they thought they were getting the lowest rates possible, but that simply was not the case. They were shocked at their price savings once we were ﬁnished consolidating their contracts.</p>
<br /><p>With any business or organization we work with, we help them:</p>
<br /><p>All of this leads to cost savings and less hassle for the billing department to reconcile invoices.</p>
<br /><p>Unfortunately, optimizing and consolidating these agreements is no easy task. Vendor agreements in the print industry are notoriously tough. While addressing the varied nuances is outside the scope of this whitepaper, you cannot simply break a contract or renegotiate. There are countless hoops to jump through and roadblocks to overcome on the road to an optimized program.</p>
<br /><p>There are many variables when it comes to choosing the right lease duration, and comparing your options is extremely diﬃcult when you don’t know what to look for. At P3 Cost Analysts, we take on all that responsibility for our customers. With our industry expertise, we are able to conduct a proper comparison between vendors and their oﬀerings, leaving our customers with the best possible lease agreements and print programs.</p>
<br /><p>Customers can rest assured that we know what competitive pricing and well-structured print programs look like.</p>
<br /><p>Just as important as cost savings, you need to ensure that the level of service and print equipment the customers receive stays the same amidst contract negotiations. By working with us, all of our customers will get better service, better equipment, and all the cost savings on top of these.</p>
<br /><p>One thing that rarely gets communicated to customers is that they should get a certain number of technicians on their account based on their volume of pages produced. For example, an accepted industry benchmark is for every one million pages produced, that account needs to have one full-time service technician available to service that ﬂeet of machines. But, if you don’t know how to negotiate this benchmark, and if it’s not clearly outlined in your contract, you will almost certainly not get the service you need and deserve.</p>
<br /><p>For Example</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a large university on the West Coast that was producing 100 million pages per month, but they did not have any technicians assigned to their account prior to our involvement. We told them they were getting short-changed on service and we made sure to get the appropriate technician agreement into their new contract.</p>
<br /><p>Since we are aware of these benchmarks and know they should be in the contracts, we ensure that all of our customers have the proper service they deserve.</p>
<br /><p>Sometimes, with speciﬁc types of accounts, vendors have allotted marketing dollars available to help secure the deal. Vendors could use this money to sponsor the school football team, reduce the cost of their equipment or services, give away free toner, and many other things to attract customers. Many sales teams will also get a bonus when they can replace a competitor’s machine with their own.</p>
<br /><p>Vendors will deny this money exists and that it rarely gets passed on to customers. However, we know this money is available and we are able to leverage this knowledge to beneﬁt our customers. In many cases, we are able to get our customers around $100,000 in signing bonuses. They would never have gotten this money if they negotiated their contracts on their own because they would not have asked for it nor known how to get it included in the contract.</p>
<br /><p>Based on our experience, we can conﬁdently say we save customers a minimum of 30%-50% on managed print services, with our average savings being 38%.</p>
<br /><p>By leveraging our expertise and looking at the totality of all cost factors, we have a consistent process for ﬁnding savings for all of our customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather invoices and contract information from clients on their managed print program. In this category, we are often able to obtain this information from the vendors directly, further saving the client time.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we do a thorough assessment of our client’s managed print programs. 	Applying decades of expertise in this industry, we review contracts, machines, volumes, and costs down to the penny. We run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4-6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our ﬁndings and recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Once our ﬁndings are approved, we work with the vendor to secure new agreements and set up the most cost-eﬃcient program.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure savings stay intact and vendors honor the agreements and pricing. We have found vendors are constantly violating their own agreements and we monitor and ﬁght oﬀ unwarranted price increases and overcharges on our client's behalf. Furthermore, we monitor market conditions and look for ways to keep costs down or drive them lower.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>If you are a large business or organization with a high volume of managed print services, the only way you can effectively save on these costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>When your business is faced with opportunities to expand, it’s a must to consider economic incentive procurement as part of company planning.</p>
<br /><p>At P3 Cost Analysts, we help our clients add millions to their bottom line through economic incentive packages and consulting. </p>
<br /><p>Many states will generally compete for jobs, so it’s critical for companies to be able to effectively negotiate and take advantage of state and local incentive programs.</p>
<br /><p>Obtaining corporate growth incentives is not straightforward, requiring significant research, negotiations, and planning – at least six to nine months ahead of construction.</p>
<br /><p>All too often, companies start the planning process too late and as a result, they miss out on the highest-level benefit opportunity.</p>

<br /><p>Our merchant processing audit service helps businesses that accept credit cards for payment.  </p>
<br /><p>Many businesses accept credit cards and most understand how to negotiate their base fee.   </p>
<br /><p>If you are a business owner and have looked at your statements and bills though, you may not be surprised to know that there can be a litany of other fees that dot your credit card processing statements as well. How these are calculated is often shrouded in mystery and can be very difficult to understand. These fees often contain errors and overcharges as well. </p>
<br /><p>Furthermore, there are a variety of factors that go into determining how and at what amount these fees will be charged. </p>

<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Any business that accepts credit cards or other electronic payment methods works with a merchant processing provider. Also known as payment processing providers or credit card processing providers, these third-party entities are the middlemen between you (the merchant) and card-issuing banks.</p>
<br /><p>Without knowing any better, most businesses shop around for the best processing rates and think that’s all they can do to minimize costs in this area. But, only around 20% of possible savings for customers come from negotiating better processing rates.</p>
<br /><p>The real savings on merchant processing services can only be uncovered through a detailed merchant processing audit.</p>
<br /><p>To better understand how you can start cutting merchant processing costs, we’ll take an in-depth look at the moving parts of this industry, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The merchant processing industry is foundational for the facilitation of credit/debit card and other electronic payment transactions across the world. There is a vast amount of merchant service providers, and depending on the size of your company and the tools or services the providers oﬀer, some will be a better ﬁt for your business than others.</p>
<br /><p>Though the services oﬀered by merchant processing providers are pretty similar across the board, fees vary from provider to provider, and so does the level of customer service. Both factors need to be considered when choosing a provider you can rely on.</p>
<br /><p>Any time a business accepts a card payment, the card information gets sent to the merchant processor who then directs the transaction data to the card-issuing bank (the customer’s bank) for approval. Once approved, the processor receives conﬁrmation and directs funds to your merchant account within the acquiring bank.</p>
<br /><p>As you can imagine, this transaction process involves many data exchanges between banks, card companies, and merchant processors. As we’ll see, each link in this chain has criteria by which they base their charges and fees. By understanding how you are charged for these services, you can start to optimize spending in this cost category.</p>
<br /><p>Merchant Processor Transaction Fees:</p>
<br /><p>The transaction fees charged by a merchant processor are what most customers think of when considering fees in this cost category. Whenever a business takes payment that needs to be processed, there is a fee that is paid to the merchant processor. The merchant processor sets these rates based on the margin of</p>
<br /><p>proﬁt they want to receive after they’ve paid out interchange fees to</p>
<br /><p>card-issuing banks.</p>
<br /><p>Interchange Fees:</p>
<br /><p>An interchange is a set of qualiﬁcations and categories that credit card companies use to deﬁne the fees and rates for various types of card transactions. There are many factors that determine these interchange fees including, but not limited to:</p>
<br /><p>To clarify, these interchange fees are set by the card associations and not the merchant processing providers. The merchant processor initially pays these fees to the card-issuing banks, but then these costs ultimately get passed on to the merchant by the processor.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The most signiﬁcant possible savings in this cost category comes from interchange optimization. With so many diﬀerent interchange categories and other qualiﬁcations, it’s common for merchants to be functioning within categories that have higher rates than they actually need to be paying.</p>
<br /><p>At P3 Cost Analysts, we look for situations where merchants can qualify for incentivized or reduced interchange programs based on their SIC code. We seek out solutions merchants can implement that will help them qualify for the lowest interchange possible. Furthermore, we know what the bare minimum margin tolerance merchant processing providers will accept, giving us the insight needed to get the best interchange rates possible.</p>
<br /><p>For Example:</p>
<br /><p>If you own and operate a ﬁtness studio, you have a speciﬁc SIC code for that type of business. But, since you also teach at that studio, you qualify for a special educational interchange category that can reduce your interchange costs.</p>
<br /><p>The average owner would not know they qualify for this interchange because it’s not directly communicated to the owner by the merchant processing provider.</p>
<br /><p>Another way we can optimize interchange fees is by prescribing better payment gateways for merchants. A gateway is a device merchants use to take payment, and each type of device sends certain kinds of data. This data is deﬁned as level 1, level 2, and level 3, with level 3 being the most detailed kind of data. Every time you can process higher-level data, you get a reduction in interchange fees.</p>
<br /><p>With the right gateway, merchants could potentially process level 3 data when they were only processing level 1 or 2 data previously.</p>
<br /><p>Example:</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a B2B construction materials company that was only clearing transactions at levels 1 and 2. We were able to help them implement an oﬀ-the-shelf level 3 solution that ended up saving them over $30K per month in transaction fees without having to change their merchant processing provider.</p>
<br /><p>Merchant processing fee negotiation:</p>
<br /><p>Since we have deep knowledge of industry benchmarks and pricing, we are typically able to negotiate better rates with merchant processing providers. As mentioned earlier, these negotiations only make up about 20% of possible savings.</p>
<br /><p>Eliminating fake fees:</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, merchant processing providers add on fake fees and costs that can be disputed and reimbursed to merchants.</p>
<br /><p>Chargeback fees:</p>
<br /><p>If a merchant has a lot of disputed transactions, these chargeback fees can start adding up quickly. With our expertise, we are able to work with the merchant to reduce the losses from these chargebacks.</p>
<br /><p>Prescribing alternative payment methods:</p>
<br /><p>In cases where the merchant has a lot of recurring transactions, we can implement ACH solutions that clear transactions at a much lower cost than credit cards. This is a good way to eliminate certain credit card transactions and reduce spending.</p>
<br /><p>In rare cases, we’ll help merchants use an aggregator such as PayPal or Square, instead of a traditional merchant processing provider when it makes sense.</p>
<br /><p>Spotting and correcting padded interchange fees:</p>
<br /><p>Some merchant processors will pad their interchange fee, meaning they are adding additional fees on top of the actual interchange costs. We are able to catch this practice in action by looking at a list of the published interchange categories and comparing them to the merchant processor pricing.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather invoices and contract information from clients about their merchant processing provider. In this category, we are often able to obtain this information from the vendors directly, further saving the client time.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we do a thorough assessment of our client’s interchange categories and merchant processing provider fees. Applying decades of expertise in this industry, we run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4–6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our ﬁndings and recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Once our ﬁndings are approved, we work with the merchant processing provider to secure new agreements and set up the most cost-eﬃcient program.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure savings stay intact and providers honor the agreements and pricing.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>With the help of P3 Cost Analysts, our clients are able to save 15%–20% on merchant processing costs.</p>

<br /><p>In some cases, clients don’t think they’ll understand the savings we bring and therefore are uncertain about moving forward. We respond by highlighting the fact that we sit down with all of our clients to explain what the savings are and how we found them. We would never make you pay a savings invoice that you don’t understand or agree with.</p>
<br /><p>Other times, clients worry that they’ll lose a sense of control over their systems and providers. They think that we could make decisions that they don’t agree with. We respond by making it known that we will review any implementations or action steps with them before moving forward with our recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Lastly, some clients think working with us will take too much time. This has never been the case in our many years of merchant processing auditing. In fact, our clients typically spend less than two hours of their own time throughout the entire merchant processing audit.</p>
<br /><p>If you are a business or organization with a high volume of credit card or other electronic payment transactions, the only way you can effectively save on these costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or to outsource to professionals.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re interested in having P3 Cost Analysts take a look at your merchant processing bills and see what our auditors can uncover, reach out to us on our website, by filling out our contact form, or calling 1-877-843-7579, and we’ll be in touch.</p>

<br /><p>Many of today’s companies fail to realize the importance of auditing utility budgets and the accompanying monthly charges. Too often spending in this category is not verified due to an assumption of accuracy and cost efficiency. We often hear “as long as it looks right, we pay them.” It is not good business to pay invoices based on an assumption. The utility company’s position is that it is your responsibility to verify your bills. By assuming your bills are correct or there is nothing you can do leaves your company vulnerable to errors and overcharges. P3 Cost Analysts helps you take back control of your budget and spending for utility and telecommunications. A utility audit may be the best thing you can do now and in the future for your company, with the potential of refunds and savings going straight to your bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>In an attempt to make sure money spent is not money wasted, we offer the following services:</p>

<br /><p>When businesses ﬁrst consider ways to cut utility costs, they typically think in terms of reducing usage. From installing energy efficient light bulbs and switches to lowering water consumption, these tactics are often the only thoughts that come to mind. And though reducing usage is a good practice, businesses are missing many savings opportunities on utilities by assuming that utilities costs themselves are largely ﬁxed. </p>
<br /><p>With the utility industry being highly regulated, it’s easy to see why many companies fall under the ﬁxed cost assumption. Because utility tariffs and fees are so complex, unless you have a utility expert looking under the hood of your utility statements and actually knowing what to look for, there are many errors and overcharges that will go unnoticed.</p>
<br /><p>To see any real change in utility savings, a deep audit of your records and statements is a necessity. Some may think they have people in-house that are already monitoring for errors, but the fact is, utility cost auditing requires specialty training that is never their core competency. </p>
<br /><p>In this white paper, we will outline how the utility industry functions, explore the types of errors and overcharges that go unnoticed, reveal how our experts at P3 Cost Analysts work through an auditing process, and share some examples of tangible savings we discover for clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Most businesses may know whether or not they operate in a regulated or deregulated energy market. If their energy provider has a government granted monopoly in the state or region, then they’re in a regulated market. If multiple providers compete to be their energy provider, they’re in a deregulated market. The type of market a business functions in depends on the state in which they’re located, with the majority of states operating in a regulated market.</p>
<br /><p>In regulated markets, the utility provider is a single entity that handles the entire supply chain of energy. In deregulated markets, on the other hand, while there may still be one main energy provider, they can sell energy to multiple third parties, who set their own rates and become the energy suppliers for the business. In either regulated or deregulated markets, it’s always up to the consumer, not the vendor, to ﬁnd savings.</p>
<br /><p>Energy Tariffs apply to both regulated and deregulated markets and dictate how much energy suppliers charge customers based on their type of industry, usage, time of usage, and many other factors outlined in lengthy and complex documents.</p>
<br /><p>It’s highly difficult (if not impossible) for non-experts to understand how these tariffs are billed because there are so many provisions, and they’re written for the utility company, not for the customer to understand. You can click here to try and calculate a simple electric bill. You also automatically get billed for all tariffs riders unless you take action to opt out. And even when you do take action to opt out, the utility company might tell you that you’ll lose other beneﬁts if you do not implement changes correctly.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>A manufacturing company may qualify for a lower tier of billing if 40% of their energy usage comes from natural gas. However, this incentive only applies if the business is using that natural gas at certain times of the day. As such, if the business isn’t aware of the incentive or doesn’t have the right tracking systems in place to take advantage of the incentive, they may miss out on savings.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>All of the errors found in the billing process are based on algorithms, numbers, improper calculations, and impossibilities. With our expertise, we understand what the utility companies are liable for in regards to errors. This allows us to determine whether refunds are applicable or not and to prove to the utility company how a certain error occurred within their own regulations.</p>
<br /><p>Hours used can be deﬁned as the number of hours you used your electricity based on your peak demand.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>If a company uses 50,000 kWh and has a peak demand of 100kW, the hours used is 500 (50,000/100 = 500). In a 30-day bill cycle, there is a maximum of 720 hours (24 hours x 30 days). If the hours used in a 30-day bill cycle computes 750 hours, it simply is an impossibility, and we know there is an error.</p>
<br /><p>This efficiency percentage can never be greater than 100%. Thus, if the load factor calculation the utility company presents is over 100%, there is a clear error.</p>
<br /><p>Utility companies are allowed to estimate bills based on the history of the business’ electrical usage, but that estimate can be wrong upon closer inspection of the records. One area we look at is estimated demands. “Demand” is the highest amount of energy, measured in kilowatts of kilovolts, that a company uses over a short period of time. Many electric meters require the demand to be reset to zero after each meter read.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>If the estimated demand is 100 kW, but the previous actual meter read was 90 kW and the next actual read was 70 kW, we know it’s impossible for the demand to be 100 kW this time because they must not have reset the meter after the previous reading.</p>
<br /><p>A demand ratchet is the percentage of your peak demand that you have to pay each month even if you don’t use that energy. We look for times when the demand reading might trigger a demand ratchet or other multipliers that bring the client into a higher tier for kilowatt charges and make the necessary changes to fall under the correct tier. Without these ﬁxes, a client could stay in the wrong pricing tier for up to 12 months, leading to many extra charges.</p>
<br /><p>These percentages vary, and if you do not understand them, you can fall into a higher ratchet than you need to be.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>A company is currently paying 100% of their demand ratchet. But since they heat their buildings with 100% electricity instead of gas, their tari. allows them to pay a 50% demand ratchet. Until this gets noticed, they will be wasting a lot of money that they don’t need to.</p>
<br /><p>In most water billing errors, there’s an issue with how a company is being billed for their sewage. Sewage billing is based on a percentage of water consumption, which in many states is 100%. Some companies, however, are billed at 100% of water consumption when in fact not all of their water is going into sewage.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>Breweries use large quantities of water to brew their beer, but that water isn’t going back into sewage - it’s going out into the tap room and out the door in cans. Thus, they shouldn’t be charged 100% for sewage based on how they use their water.</p>
<br /><p>Many municipalities use computers to read the meters. If the data is not entered into the computer correctly on the front end, or if the computer simply makes an error, overcharges can occur.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>We went to work for one client and noticed the water meter was being read correctly. However, due to an error in the software, the sewer usage was being calculated at a rate of 10x. Thus, while the fees and readings themselves were accurate, the usage calculation was not. This resulted in a 10x overcharge on the client’s sewer fees.</p>
<br /><p>Most of the errors with gas involve the utility company not billing based on the contractual terms. A customer will enter into a contract with a utility company, but the utility company won’t act according to the contractual terms.</p>
<br /><p>With some tariffs and regions, the tariffs are set to change automatically. This means that if usage falls or increases, a customer may be moved or ‘defaulted’ into a lower or higher tariffs bracket. Generally, this will result in the most cost-effective rate for the customer. However, these automatic changes routinely fail to occur. Only through a deep analysis of historical usage can a customer determine if an error has occurred.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>We had one client who had four different natural gas accounts. Two of them were billed on the General Large tariffs and two of them were billed on the General Small tariffs. The usage, however, indicated that all four accounts should have been billed on the General Small tariffs.</p>
<br /><p>The vendor initially fought this claim, as they did not want to issue a refund for the mistake or reduce their revenue. However, after escalating the claim up to the vendor’s senior management, we were able to recover the overcharge.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>When you consider the complexity of tariffs and the numerous errors that can occur in the utility billing process, it makes sense to do a deep audit and reap the savings of doing so. With the P3 Utility Auditing solution, you can take advantage of this auditing process risk free. There’s no charge for the hundreds of hours of upfront auditing time by our experts. We simply receive 50% of the</p>
<br /><p>savings we find for a period of 60 months. About 99% of the time, clients allow us to implement what we find because our recommendations make sense and produce real savings.</p>
<br /><p>Note: The process below mostly applies to companies in regulated markets. In deregulated markets, P3 simply acts as an energy broker monitoring the market, knowing the best time to lock in a contract, and receiving a small commission on these arrangements. There are still opportunities to ﬁnd billing errors, but we don’t share in the kilowatt per hour rate reductions like we do in regulated markets.</p>
<br /><p>We schedule a 15-20 minute meeting to explain our shared savings agreement and the materials we need to get started, including copies of invoices and authorization documents.</p>
<br /><p>We work with the client to gain access to 12 - 36 months of invoices, depending on the statute of limitations in their state (often, if we have the vendor online logins, we may only need a single invoice).</p>
<br /><p>Our experts start dissecting invoices and provide the client with weekly or bi-weekly updates on overcharges and errors found. We also deliver these savings as we go instead of waiting until the end of the audit.</p>
<br /><p>This phase can take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to get the initial results for a mid-size client, and then once these ﬁndings are represented to the client, it can take another 4-6 weeks to get those savings implemented, depending on which part of the billing cycle we step in.</p>
<br /><p>After the initial audit, we move into the ongoing auditing phase where we monitor invoices every month and make sure errors don’t continue to appear and that the savings are intact.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In some cases, clients have been in business for decades and think that what they’re doing “works” and they don’t need to change anything. Some may also look at the P3 Utility Auditing solution as “too good to be true,” leading to general skepticism about the offering.</p>
<br /><p>Others believe the people they have in-house monitoring utility charges are sufficient. The controller or accounts payable department is typically the one in charge of managing this, but this area is never anyone’s core competency. While these people have hundreds of other things on their plates, they may worry about us making them look bad when we ﬁnd many savings that went unnoticed previously.</p>
<br /><p>In response to these objections, it should be clariﬁed that our sole purpose is to optimize savings, and that the time and expertise involved to audit these correctly is immense. What companies are already doing may work to an extent, but we have the expertise to take savings to the next level. We provide a valuable service that supplements and supports our clients moving forward. It’s a win-win relationship that has proven results.</p>
<br /><p>Through this analysis, it has become clear that achieving real savings on utilities is complex. Between all the nuances with tariffs and billing, it’s difﬁcult for customers to ﬁnd these savings on their own. Luckily, with the help of utility auditing experts, a number of errors can be discovered through a detailed audit leading to many savings. And the best part of this process is that it’s risk free, with no upfront charges and only savings.</p>

<br /><p>The global market for Telecom Managed Services is expected to reach US$26.2 billion by 2025. Such a remarkable forecast reveals the undeniable value and escalating demand for these services in modern business. In an era where technology is not only everywhere but constantly evolving, the need for expertly managed communications services becomes even more apparent.</p>
<br /><p>So, what exactly are telecommunications managed services? Their definition and scope are ever-changing. This article offers a comprehensive look into the various components of managed telecom services. We’ll break down their functionalities, the key benefits they offer, and the alternative approaches businesses might consider.</p>
<br /><p>Keep reading to explore the role these services play in the modern business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Managed Telecom Services involve outsourcing the management and maintenance of an organization’s telecommunications infrastructure to a third-party provider. The primary objective is to let businesses concentrate on their core competencies, ensuring their telecommunications requirements are in the hands of seasoned professionals.</p>
<br /><p>Given the astonishing rate at which technology is advancing today, the role of an in-house IT department is intensifying. Keeping up with daily technological advancements is not just challenging, but it’s quickly becoming a full-time job in itself. As more and more businesses integrate high-tech solutions into their operations, the demands on the IT department build up.</p>
<br /><p>The quest for secure, reliable, and efficient connections has never been so critical. Now, when almost every business operation hinges on technology, ensuring a highly functioning telecommunications system is crucial. It’s amidst these challenges that businesses increasingly turn to Managed Telecom Services as a solution to streamline, secure, and enhance their communications infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>In an age where effective communication is the cornerstone of business success, understanding the services offered by telecom management professionals is essential. Let’s dive into the specifics of what telecom managed service providers bring to the table:</p>
<br /><p>Networks form the backbone of modern telecommunications. Managed network services ensure that both voice and data networks operate smoothly, with minimal downtime and optimal performance.</p>
<br /><p>Data drives decisions in the modern business landscape. These services encompass the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data, ensuring businesses have access to critical information when needed.</p>
<br /><p>From traditional phone lines to cutting-edge VoIP and unified communications, managed communication services ensure businesses can communicate internally and externally without any hitches.</p>
<br /><p>Managing mobile devices, apps, and networks is crucial with the rise of remote work and the need for on-the-go connectivity. These services help businesses stay connected, no matter where they are.</p>
<br /><p>Data centers are the heart of many organizations, hosting critical applications and data. These services oversee the infrastructure, ensuring high availability and performance.</p>
<br /><p>In an era of rising cyber threats, securing telecommunication infrastructures is paramount. Managed security services provide continuous monitoring, threat detection, and response measures to safeguard assets.</p>
<br /><p>The hardware that forms the foundation of telecommunications shouldn’t be overlooked. Managed IT equipment services take care of maintaining, updating, and ensuring that devices like routers, switches, servers, and other crucial components operate optimally.</p>
<br /><p>Software drives many of the functions in telecom networks, from routing calls to ensuring data security. Managed software services ensure that all software components are up-to-date, bug-free, and tailored to the organization’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring a blend of expertise, state-of-the-art tools, and proactive methodologies, offering businesses an edge in a competitive landscape. Here are some of the compelling advantages of this partnership:</p>
<br /><p>By partnering with a managed service provider, organizations can achieve significant cost savings. Instead of sustaining the expenses of an extensive in-house team or constantly updating technology, businesses can leverage the economies of scale provided by these experts.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring expertise that helps streamline telecom operations. Their proficiency eliminates unnecessary complexities, allowing businesses to function more smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<br /><p>With the technical aspects of IT and telecommunications managed externally, internal staff can center their efforts on the organization’s core objectives. This focus ensures that staff productivity remains high and is unhampered by tech-related distractions.</p>
<br /><p>Outsourcing management means issues like compatibility across cloud applications, performance challenges, and rapid service development are taken care of by the service provider. Organizations can thus remain confident in the reliability and scalability of their tech infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers offer solutions tailored to the unique requirements and goals of each business. This customization ensures that the technology infrastructure and services align perfectly with the organization’s objectives.</p>
<br /><p>Constant oversight is a hallmark of professionally managed service providers. They not only provide 24/7 monitoring but also offer insights through regular performance tracking, enabling informed strategic decision-making.</p>
<br /><p>There is another side to the coin. Telecom managed service providers come with their own set of expenses. So, what’s the alternative? Cost reduction firms like P3 Cost Analysts specialize in telecom auditing, finding discrepancies in billing, and ensuring businesses only pay for what they use. Here’s what P3 brings to the table:</p>
<br /><p>The P3 model focuses on transparency and saving money rather than additional expenses. For businesses tight on budget or looking for efficiency, P3 provides a compelling alternative.</p>
<br /><p>Take, for instance, a recent case study involving a school system. Despite the client paying optimal rates, P3 identified a billing error that had persisted for years. Upon extensive negotiation, the client was rewarded with a hefty refund check of $150,000 and a monthly bill reduction of over $3,000.</p>
<br /><p>This scenario underscores P3’s diligent commitment to ensuring clients are only billed for what they should be.</p>
<br /><p>In our exploration of Telecom Managed Services, we’ve seen how they present a comprehensive solution for businesses, addressing every aspect of telecommunication needs. These services offer an array of benefits, from streamlining operations to enhancing technological infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>While these advantages are clear, it’s crucial for organizations to assess their unique needs and financial landscape. Many will find that the financial inspection provided by a telecom audit company, such as P3 Cost Analysts, aligns more seamlessly with their end goals.</p>

<br /><p>Starting a franchise is a great option for women looking to maintain a work-life balance while fulfilling their dream of running a business. In fact, the number of female franchise owners has nearly doubled over the past decade, and more than a third of franchise owners are now women.</p>
<br /><p>This rise in female-led franchising aligns with a broader shift towards empowering women entrepreneurs in all fields. Women are increasingly seeking opportunities that not only align with their professional goals but also accommodate their personal and family commitments.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we’ll explore the diverse range of franchise opportunities particularly suited for women. We’ll examine key factors such as location flexibility, comprehensive franchisee support, upfront costs, and promising market opportunities. These elements are vital in identifying franchises that not only promise success but also align with the unique needs and aspirations of women entrepreneurs today.</p>

<br /><p>If you’re not already an experienced business owner, all the technical jargon may be confusing when you start evaluating potential franchise opportunities. Understanding the nuances between revenue and profit, net worth and liquid capital, or minimum cash and startup costs may not come naturally to those who don’t have a business degree. That doesn’t mean you won’t make a good franchisee. It just means you need to do a little legwork first.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at one of the key components in determining if a franchise opportunity will work for you – liquid capital. Understanding the concept of liquid capital, how much you need, and how to get it for your franchise is crucial to start your entrepreneurial journey. So, let’s dive into the details!</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital, often referred to as liquid assets, is any asset that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without losing its value. In regards to opening a franchise, liquid capital is essentially your ready-to-use funds that can be utilized immediately for any necessary expenses.</p>
<br /><p>So, what does liquid capital mean for potential franchisees? It’s easy to confuse liquid capital with the amount due to the franchisor. While the total liquid capital required for a franchisee certainly encompasses costs to cover the franchise fee, it also extends to other startup expenses necessary to kickstart the business. These costs may include rent or real estate, training, inventory, and additional overheads.</p>
<br /><p>Another common misconception among franchisees is thinking that liquid capital and net worth are the same thing. Net worth is the cumulative total of both liquid (easily convertible to cash) and illiquid assets (assets that are not readily convertible to cash). In contrast, liquid capital, as highlighted in the examples below, includes only those assets that can be swiftly converted into cash.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the difference between liquid capital and net worth is crucial when planning your franchise investment. More importantly, it helps you guarantee that you can meet the minimum liquid capital requirements of the franchise opportunity you’re interested in.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to acquiring a franchise, potential franchisees should be aware of various sources of liquid capital at their disposal. Let’s look at some of the most common examples.</p>
<br /><p>At the top of the list of liquid capital examples is cash or the balance you have in your savings account. This cash can be quickly and easily used for any immediate business needs.</p>
<br /><p>Stocks, bonds, and other marketable securities also qualify as liquid capital. Their value lies in their marketability – they can be sold on the stock exchange, providing a quick influx of cash when required. However, it’s important to remember that the selling price is dependent on the market conditions at the time of sale.</p>
<br /><p>Mutual funds, essentially pools of diversified investments, constitute another form of liquid capital. Despite the complexity of these investments, they can typically be sold within a few business days, transforming into cash at hand.</p>
<br /><p>Similar to mutual funds, money market funds are a type of investment fund. They are considered highly liquid due to their short-term nature. This allows for quick conversion to cash, further adding to your liquid capital.</p>
<br /><p>While understanding what counts as liquid capital is integral to your franchise investment journey, it’s equally important to recognize non-liquid assets. Non-liquid capital refers to assets that cannot be quickly converted into cash without potentially losing value. Here are some common examples:</p>
<br /><p>Properties, whether residential or commercial, fall under the category of non-liquid capital. Despite their considerable value, they can’t be quickly or easily sold without the risk of a price drop. Real estate transactions can take weeks or even months to complete, which doesn’t offer the immediate accessibility that liquid capital does.</p>
<br /><p>Items like art, antiques, rare coins, or other collectibles are also considered non-liquid capital. While they may hold value, finding a buyer willing to pay that value can be a time-consuming process, making them a less optimal source of capital.</p>
<br /><p>Machinery, vehicles, or other equipment related to your business or personal use are also forms of non-liquid capital. Although these assets might be highly valuable, selling them for their true worth could be challenging and time-consuming, hence their classification as non-liquid.</p>
<br /><p>For individuals below retirement age, retirement accounts generally fall under non-liquid assets. Despite their substantial value, accessing these funds early can invite penalties and tax implications, making them less ideal as a source of liquid capital for a franchise investment.</p>
<br /><p>Potential investors often focus on the initial franchise fee when considering buying a franchise. However, the financial aspect of owning a franchise extends far beyond this initial payment. Franchises generally set a minimum liquid capital requirement for potential franchisees. This ensures that they possess the requisite financial backing, not just for the initial purchase but also to sustain the franchise until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>The term “liquid capital” might vary in definition across franchises. Some may have a more expansive interpretation of what assets count as liquid, while others might be more restrictive. It’s essential to thoroughly understand and align with the specific definitions set by the franchise you’re considering by reading over the Franchise Disclosure Document.</p>
<br /><p>Beyond the initial investment, franchises come with various startup costs, from leasing space and acquiring inventory to training staff and launching marketing initiatives. Furthermore, achieving profitability in a new business doesn’t happen overnight. There might be a period where expenses surpass revenue, especially in the initial stages. During such times, liquid capital acts as a financial safety net, ensuring the business can continue its operations uninterrupted. It provides the franchisee with a buffer to navigate early challenges, making it a crucial aspect of the franchising journey.</p>
<br /><p>In general, most franchises will have a minimum requirement of $50,000 in liquid assets. However, some demand much more. For instance, the P3 Cost Analysts franchise has a relatively low cash minimum of $59,500. Meanwhile, other franchise opportunities will differ. KFC, for example, requires potential franchisees to have $750,000 in liquid assets.</p>
<br /><p>However, it’s essential to ensure that diving into a franchise doesn’t put you in a bad spot financially. Maintaining a cushion for personal expenses and unforeseen business challenges is crucial. Though thorough research and due diligence can help in selecting a promising franchise, there’s an inherent risk in starting a business. Therefore, it’s wise to ensure you have enough liquid capital in reserve to pay personal bills and expenses during the initial phases when profitability might not be immediate.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you are planning to buy a franchise or are just starting your research, you might be wondering, “How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?” If your money isn’t easily accessible in your savings accounts, you may have convertible assets that can add to your total available. Here are a few options to consider:</p>
<br /><p>This is the most straightforward way to accumulate liquid capital. By saving a portion of your income over time, you can build up your liquid capital reserves without borrowing or selling assets.</p>
<br /><p>If you have personal assets such as valuable collectibles or equipment, you could sell these to generate liquid capital. However, this should be done with caution as it could have tax implications and also reduce your net worth.</p>
<br /><p>Tapping into your home’s equity through a HELOC can provide ready funds. As you repay your mortgage and your property’s value increases, you accumulate equity, which can be borrowed against for liquid capital. This option often has lower interest rates than other loans, but remember, your home serves as the collateral. If you can’t pay back the loan, you risk losing your property.</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, you might have family members or friends willing to invest in your franchise business. However, this option should be approached carefully to avoid any future disagreements or strained relationships.</p>
<br /><p>How does liquid capital work?</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital refers to assets that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without significant loss in value. In the context of business, it represents readily available funds that can be used to cover immediate and short-term needs, such as payroll, rent, and inventory.</p>
<br /><p>How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Two common ways to gather liquid capital for a franchise include tapping into personal savings or selling personal assets, such as stocks, collectibles, or valuable equipment.</p>
<br /><p>Is a 401k considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>While a 401k holds value and can be accessed, it’s not typically classified as liquid capital because withdrawing funds early can result in penalties and tax consequences. However, using strategies like Rollover for Business Startups (ROBS), individuals can tap into their 401k to finance a franchise without penalties.</p>
<br /><p>Is a loan considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>Some franchisors do not regard borrowed money as liquid capital. This is because loans come with the obligation of repayment, which can impact the financial stability of the franchisee.</p>
<br /><p>Is a house a liquid asset?</p>
<br /><p>Generally, a house is a non-liquid asset. Selling it to convert it into cash can be time-consuming and depends on current market conditions.</p>
<br /><p>How to get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Acquiring liquid assets can be done by building up personal savings over time or by selling personal assets like stocks or collectibles.</p>
<br /><p>Choosing franchises with minimal buy-in requirements, such as P3 Cost Analysts, can ease financial pressures. With reasonable franchise costs, startup expenses, and overheads, it’s a financially accessible venture that still allows for a healthy ROI.</p>
<br /><p>Yet, low startup costs do not imply a lack of support. At P3, affordability and support go hand in hand.

By comprehending what constitutes liquid capital, its importance, and ways to acquire it, you’re better positioned to make informed decisions.</p>

<br /><p>Contracts are a necessary part of running a business. Different companies must have clear expectations and hold each other accountable in order for everyone’s operations to run smoothly. However, these contractual agreements can be one-sided, making it hard for the smaller player to stand up for themselves.</p>
<br /><p>Waste management companies are notorious for these unfair contracts, and Republic Services is no exception. There are many people out there trying to cancel Republic Services, only to be met with a complicated process or no response from their representatives. If this is you, keep reading to get a better understanding of the Republic Services cancellation process and figure out how to get the help you need.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services is a prominent waste management company that provides a comprehensive range of waste collection and disposal services. Claiming a commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, Republic Services focuses on managing waste responsibly while offering efficient and reliable solutions. The company serves millions of residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers across the United States.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services offers various waste management services tailored to meet diverse needs. Their residential services encompass curbside waste collection, recycling programs, and yard waste removal. For businesses, Republic Services provides customized waste and recycling solutions, including commercial dumpster rentals, compactor services, and comprehensive waste management plans.</p>
<br /><p>Many people find themselves or their business in an undesirable contract with Republic Services. Often, these contracts have favorable terms for Republic Services, while the other party gets the short end of the stick.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re considering entering into an agreement with Republic Services, you should consider the following things:</p>
<br /><p>Additional fees popping up on your invoice are not unique to Republic Services. The entire waste management industry is known for having billing errors and overcharges on their invoices. Republic Services outlines the fees that may appear on their invoices in the contract for invoice-to-invoice agreements. These include:</p>
<br /><p>Not only should you expect your contract to include clauses for many different types of fees, but Republic Services is also known to include rate increases for services that may or may not be lawful. The waste management company has been on the receiving end of various lawsuits due to unlawful rate increases and fuel recovery fees, according to the website Republic Services Exposed. Knowing that Republic has already had issues with unlawful rate increases may cause business owners to seek Republic Services’ contract termination methods.</p>
<br /><p>The same website also reports that Republic Services has been forced to refund millions of dollars to their customers due to unauthorized fees and overcharges. Customers are responsible for finding these errors and invoices and submitting a claim for a refund. Most business owners don’t have time to dedicate to this process and therefore end up overspending on trash collection. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can help businesses immensely by handling invoice audits for them or helping them cancel Republic Services.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to employing questionable contract tactics, Republic Services lacks transparency and standard pricing. Some sales representatives prioritize commissions by encouraging customers to pay more for services, and business owners can’t trust that their representatives have their best interests at heart.</p>
<br /><p>If you go to the customer support portion of their website, the Republic Services Cancellation Policy looks pretty straightforward. Just give them a call and speak to your representative. In reality, many customers have a very hard time getting a hold of anyone to speak to at all.</p>
<br /><p>To guarantee the best success rate, we recommend working with a professional waste management auditor like P3 Cost Analysts, as there are numerous roadblocks not covered here Republic could put in your way. If you would like to go it alone, the following steps can serve as a guide for you.</p>
<br /><p>You should have read the fine print of your contract, like the terms and conditions, before signing. But if it’s been a while, or you didn’t pay close enough attention, you should go back to your contract before reaching out to your representative. Find out the specific cancellation requirements as outlined in your contract so you enter the conversation with all the necessary information and don’t experience any surprises.</p>
<br /><p>The next step is to call Republic Services. According to their website, you can find a phone number for your representative on the front of your invoice. Another option is to call their customer support line. Before calling, gather all the necessary account information to make the process smoother. Some customers may also have the option to cancel through the customer portal.</p>
<br /><p>It’s important to note that the Republic Services Cancellation Policy states that advance notice is required to cancel their services. Oftentimes it will not go into effect until 30 days after they receive cancellation.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re able to get a hold of your Republic Services representative or a customer support agent, clearly state that your intention is to cancel their services. Waste management companies often make it difficult for their customers to get out of the contract, so they may try to convince you to stay with them. It would be a good idea to document the time, date, and name of the representative you’re speaking with in case you run into problems down the line. It’s highly likely they will reference the contract or refer to the fact you are in an auto-renewal period at this time.</p>
<br /><p>If the representative you speak with gives you any further instructions on how to finish the Republic Services contract termination process, make sure you complete each step. This may include instructions on what to do with any equipment of theirs or official forms you need to fill out.</p>
<br /><p>There have been reports of people requesting cancellation but continuing to be charged by Republic Services. Request a confirmation of the cancellation in writing just in case they continue to charge you after your requested cancellation date. Be sure to check for future invoices and keep an eye out for any refunds you’re expecting.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re struggling with these steps on your own, save yourself the frustration. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts have decades of experience going up against giant waste-hauling companies like Republic Services. We can help you figure out how to cancel Republic Services, as well as help you find a better waste-hauling company and monitor future invoices for errors and overcharges from your next provider.</p>
<br /><p>With so many customers having issues with Republic Services and other heavy hitters such as Waste Management, some have started to look for smaller, more local waste-hauling companies that may provide a better customer experience. These organizations are also likely to be more flexible during contract negotiations.</p>
<br /><p>In many cases, Republic may be your best option. But in some cases you have choices. If you want Republic Services to stop service to your home or business, you’ll need to find another waste hauler to replace them.</p>
<br /><p>The first step is to cancel Republic Services; then you can begin shopping around for new providers. However, it’s important not to get locked into another predatory contract. P3 Cost Analysts can step in here to help you negotiate an agreement that serves you.</p>
<br /><p>There is no shortage of disappointed customers working with Republic Services, just like most of the other major waste-hauling providers. Unfortunately, these contracts are often written in favor of the supplier, leaving businesses and residences stuck with no way out.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services makes it appear that the Republic Services Stop Service Process is straightforward and simple. Just follow the steps – look at your contract, contact your representative, and request a cancellation. Unfortunately, many people don’t have such a simple experience.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re looking for help at any stage of the waste management contract process, contact P3 Cost Analysts’ waste auditors. We will help you with the Republic Services cancellation process, as well as auditing your invoices, ensuring the cost-effectiveness of your contracts, and catching overcharges.</p>

<br /><p>After over 40 years of retail auditing, I now find it invigorating to work with P3 Cost Analysts as a franchise owner and consultant. It's exhilarating to see how excited our clients become when they realize that they can save money without it costing them anything. When I'm not helping our clients save money, I enjoy spending time with our grandchildren, going to the beach, mountains, and anything South Carolina Gamecocks. I'd love to hear from you, and even if I can't help you at least I will have made another friend.</p>

<br /><p>Together let’s save your organization thousands of dollars on your most common recurring expenses (non-payroll) and vendor overcharges — we do most of the work with very little time commitment on your part! Contact me to get started... *protected email* or (603)505-7288.</p>
<br /><p>Minimum time commitment because you provide access to your invoices, and we take it from there. We do all the analysis, plan and execute to achieve cost reductions. No budget required. Compensation only comes from shared savings realized. The areas of focus include Waste Management, Utilities (gas/electric/water/sewer), Telecom/Datacom/Wireless, Managed Print (copiers and printers), Industrial Laundry (uniforms, linens, mats, towels), Merchant Accounts for B2B and B2C transactions, and Property Tax.</p>
<br /><p>Since 1991, our auditors have performed expense reduction audits for over 30,000 client locations nationwide generating hundreds of millions in savings for companies across all industries.</p>

<br /><p>When it comes to starting a business, there’s a spectrum of options, from building from the ground up to partnering with established brands. Franchises fall in the latter category, offering a blend of entrepreneurial freedom and proven systems. From local diners to global giants, franchises dominate our commercial landscape. But is owning a franchise worth it?</p>
<br /><p>Let’s cut through the noise and look into the practical aspects of franchising, examining the potential rewards, risks, and factors determining whether owning a franchise is profitable.</p>
<br /><p>A franchise is a business arrangement where an individual (franchisee) is granted the right to operate a business using an established company’s branding, products, and services (franchisor). This arrangement forms a partnership between the two parties, allowing the franchisee to replicate a proven business model with the guidance and support of the franchisor. Some common franchises that you’ve surely seen in your day-to-day life include 711 and Subway.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike starting a business from scratch, where there are many uncertainties and challenges, a franchise presents a more calculated investment. The franchisor’s track record, successful business practices, and standardized systems significantly reduce some of the inherent risks of entrepreneurship. Investors are essentially tapping into a model that has already demonstrated its viability, making the endeavor a strategic combination of investment and business pursuit.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees earn money by selling products and services within their franchised business. While sales are the primary income source, the process involves additional financial components. For instance, franchise owners pay the franchisor a franchise fee and ongoing royalties. Operating a business comes with its own set of costs as well. After accounting for all these factors, franchisees typically see a portion of the profit as their earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise costs vary widely depending on the brand, industry, and scale of the business. The initial investment encompasses the franchise fee, which could be as low as $10,000 for smaller, home-based franchises and can exceed $2 million for well-established and prominent brands.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, there are other startup expenses such as equipment, inventory, and location setup. It’s crucial to thoroughly review the franchise’s Financial Disclosure Document (FDD) to understand all costs involved before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The FDD can also help potential franchisees get a better idea of the possible return on investment (ROI) of the franchise. For example, some franchises, like McDonald’s, may require startup costs over $1 million. However, their potential for profit is also relatively high.</p>
<br /><p>Alternatively, entrepreneurs may opt for a franchise with lower initial costs but potentially similar ROI as McDonald’s.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can indeed be a wise investment decision, particularly due to their array of inherent advantages that mitigate risks and increase the potential for profitability.</p>
<br /><p>The allure of a franchise lies in its established and proven business model. Franchisors have fine-tuned their operations over time, optimizing strategies that have shown success across various locations. This proven blueprint provides franchisees with a head start, allowing them to bypass the uncertainties and trial-and-error typically associated with starting an independent business.</p>
<br /><p>A significant hurdle for new businesses is building brand recognition and trust. Franchises overcome this challenge by offering franchisees immediate access to a widely recognized and trusted brand. This brand recognition can significantly reduce the time and effort required to attract customers and establish a foothold in the market.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike independent startups, franchisees benefit from a network of resources, ongoing support, and comprehensive training provided by the franchisor. This support extends from initial setup to daily operations, guiding franchisees through challenges and helping them navigate the business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Franchises often pool resources for marketing and advertising campaigns. This collective effort boosts brand visibility and customer engagement, benefiting all franchisees within the network. Such campaigns can encompass anything from national TV advertisements to local social media initiatives.</p>
<br /><p>While franchises offer these compelling benefits, it’s important to remember that each investment decision should be well-informed and aligned with individual goals and circumstances. Thorough research, careful consideration, and seeking professional advice will help potential franchisees to decide if franchising is worth it for them.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can be profitable, but profitability depends on various factors such as the industry, location, management, the franchisee, and the specific franchise itself. Thorough research, adaptability, and a keen understanding of the local landscape are pivotal in transforming the potential for profit into reality within the world of franchising.</p>
<br /><p>While there are so many factors at play, it’s impossible to give an exact number for the potential income of a franchise owner. Franchisors won’t make any profitability promises to avoid potential litigation down the line. They may, however, offer information on the financial performance of other franchise locations.</p>
<br /><p>According to Top Franchise, the average annual income for typical franchisees is around $80,000 before factoring in taxes and expenses. While a minority of franchise owners exceed $200,000 in yearly earnings, a majority earn approximately $50,000. Of course, the profitability can vary based on your industry.</p>
<br /><p>Making the decision to invest in a franchise is a significant step toward entrepreneurship. While franchises offer a host of benefits, it’s crucial to navigate this path with strategic planning. The following are some of the essential factors to focus on when considering “Are franchises worth it?”</p>
<br /><p>When considering a franchise, align your choice with your personal strengths and passions. Your commitment and enthusiasm are crucial for long-term success. Choose a franchise that resonates with your skills and interests, increasing your chances of dedicated involvement.</p>
<br /><p>Conduct thorough market research to assess the demand for the franchise’s products or services in your chosen location. Analyzing the competition, demographics, and market trends will provide valuable insights into the potential for success.</p>
<br /><p>Evaluate your financial readiness to invest in a franchise. Beyond the initial investment, consider working capital, ongoing royalties, and operational costs. Financial planning is key to sustaining the business until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>Research the franchisor’s reputation within the industry and among franchisees. Speak with existing franchisees to gather insights into their experiences. A reputable franchisor is more likely to provide the support and resources necessary for success.</p>
<br /><p>Based on the considerations above, one should look at the P3 Cost Analysts franchise opportunity as a perfect gateway to business ownership. With a modest startup investment of just $59,500, you can step into a world of untapped earning potential.</p>

<br /><p>In the expanding world of e-commerce, delivering packages to customers’ doorsteps has become an essential and highly competitive aspect of the business. With the continued rise of online shopping, shipping carriers have had to adapt their operations to meet consumers’ increasing demands and expectations.</p>
<br /><p>One particular challenge in the shipping process is the last-mile delivery, which refers to the final leg of a package’s journey from a local distribution center to the customer’s address. Interestingly, this seemingly short distance can often be the most costly and complex part of package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx is one shipping company that has recently changed how they handle land-mile package deliveries. In 2021, the company began the rebranding from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy to keep up with the explosive growth of e-commerce and optimize its last-mile delivery process. Today, we’ll look at the former FedEx SmartPost, the shift to FedEx Ground Economy, and what that means for businesses like yours.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost was a hybrid shipping service that combined the resources of FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for package delivery. It was designed to provide a cost-effective solution for shipping lightweight packages to residential addresses by combining the speed and reliability of FedEx’s express network with the extensive reach of the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>When still operating, FedEx SmartPost utilized FedEx’s extensive express network for long-distance transportation and then handed off the packages to USPS for last-mile delivery. This collaboration allowed FedEx SmartPost to reach every U.S. residential address, including PO boxes and military residences, while offering competitive shipping rates for businesses. Despite the last mile being operated by USPS, shippers still had tracking capabilities and service available Monday to Saturday.</p>
<br /><p>The way FedEx SmartPost functioned allowed the shipping company to offer competitive shipping prices. However, the program was most useful for small, lightweight packages that weren’t time sensitive. Some shippers complained that the service was too slow or unreliable.</p>
<br /><p>The transition from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy was driven by several factors and the need to adapt to a changing market. Here are some of the likely reasons behind this decision:</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to a significant increase in package volume being shipped to residential addresses. This surge in online shopping has placed greater demands on shipping services to handle higher volumes efficiently. FedEx recognized the need to optimize its operations to meet the growing demand and provide an improved customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost’s hybrid model of utilizing both FedEx’s express network and the USPS for final delivery presented some operational complexities. The transition to FedEx Ground Economy aimed to streamline operations by consolidating operations within FedEx’s own network and utilizing contracted drivers. This allows FedEx to have more control over the entire shipping process, resulting in improved efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>By focusing on ground transportation for the entire delivery process, FedEx can optimize routes, utilize its own delivery fleet more effectively, and potentially reduce costs associated with third-party partnerships.</p>
<br /><p>Overall, the transition from FedEx SmartPost to Ground Economy was driven by the need to adapt to the changing landscape of e-commerce, optimize operational efficiency, reduce costs, and provide an improved shipping experience for customers. By streamlining operations and focusing on ground transportation, FedEx aimed to meet the evolving demands of the market while ensuring efficient and reliable package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>While FedEx SmartPost relied on FedEx’s express network and USPS for last-mile delivery, FedEx Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network, providing more control over the entire delivery process. FedEx Ground drivers, or sometimes contracted third-party drivers, complete the last-mile delivery, bringing packages directly to recipients’ addresses.</p>
<br /><p>These changes are an effort by FedEx to ensure greater reliability and faster transit times compared to SmartPost. One major change from SmartPost to Ground Economy is the addition of Sunday deliveries. Ground Economy is a strong contender for businesses looking for outbound deliveries that are low-weight and non-urgent. Still, the following options are not available for Ground Economy:</p>
<br /><p>The shift from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy began in 2019 as the company began delivering most SmartPost packages through their networks. The official rebrand happened in 2021 when they publicly introduced FedEx Ground Economy. The slow transition and similar product offerings meant that the two programs have many similarities; however, there are some key differences as well.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost utilized a hybrid model, combining FedEx’s express network for long-distance transportation and the USPS for last-mile delivery. Packages were handed off from FedEx to the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network. It relies on ground transportation methods, such as trucks, for the entire delivery process, without involving the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost shipping time was generally longer when compared to other FedEx services due to the involvement of the USPS for the last mile. Estimated FedEx SmartPost shipping time ranged from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination, and there were no Sunday deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>Estimated delivery times for Ground Economy are similar to that of SmartPost. Deliveries range from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination. However, FedEx now delivers Monday through Sunday, allowing them to shorten the average delivery time.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost Returns followed a similar process to outbound delivery. To offer returns for their customers, businesses would include a prepaid shipping label along with the shipment. Then, the customer could leave the box in their mailbox, give it to their USPS carrier, or drop it off at a FedEx office.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy returns functions nearly the same as FedEx SmartPost Returns. However, customers now have even more options, with the ability to print a shipping label from a QR code or create one online.</p>
<br /><p>Tracking was available for packages delivered through SmartPost, even once the package was handed off to USPS. The 20-digital FedEx tracking number was converted to a USPS tracking number once the handoff was processed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that Ground Economy handles delivery for the entire process, only the FedEx tracking number is needed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that we understand the similarities and differences between FedEx Ground Economy and FedEx SmartPost, we can compare them with another popular delivery option, FedEx Home Delivery. First off, Home Delivery accepts packages up to 150 pounds, while Ground Economy has a maximum of 70 pounds. In addition, Home Delivery is a bit faster, with deliveries made between one and five business days.</p>
<br /><p>However, perhaps one of the largest differences between the two programs is the contractual agreement. Ground Economy is a contract service, meaning businesses must sign an agreement with FedEx outlining the terms and conditions of the contract. Meanwhile, Home Delivery is not a contract service.</p>
<br /><p>The rebranding of FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy brings significant implications for shippers. Parcel management, with its inherent complexities and risks, requires careful attention to avoid unnecessary costs. By eliminating the handoff to USPS and taking responsibility for final mile delivery in-house, FedEx aims to streamline the process and enhance efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>However, this shift still necessitates FedEx contract negotiation and thorough FedEx invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and maximize return on investment. Companies must be vigilant in monitoring any invoice errors or unjust surcharges on their bills each month.</p>
<br /><p>The importance of analytics and shipment auditing cannot be overstated in today’s shipping industry. To address these challenges and optimize small parcel shipping costs, partnering with a cost reduction firm is your best choice. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can provide invaluable expertise and solutions. By leveraging comprehensive analytics and auditing capabilities, we help shippers make informed decisions, uncover savings opportunities, and enhance their overall shipping strategies.</p>
<br /><p>The exponential growth of e-commerce and the need for operational efficiency and cost optimization have prompted FedEx to streamline its operations and bring the entire delivery process in-house. By eliminating the transfer to USPS and relying solely on its own network, FedEx aims to enhance reliability, shorten transit times, and provide a better shipping experience for customers.</p>
<br /><p>While the transition from SmartPost to Ground Economy offers several benefits, one thing remains constant regardless of which parcel delivery service business owners choose. Shippers must carefully review their contracts with FedEx, negotiate favorable terms, and conduct thorough invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and avoid unnecessary costs.</p>
<br /><p>Partnering with a cost reduction firm like P3 Cost Analysts can provide valuable expertise and solutions in navigating the complexities of small parcel shipping. We will help you get control over your shipping expenses and make sure the delivery companies are working for you.</p>

<br /><p>In modern business, seamless shipping is the backbone of success. DHL, a prominent player in the logistics sector, extends a “helping hand” through its Money Back Guarantee Policy. This assurance is meant to ensure compensation in scenarios involving delivery delays or package non-delivery. While the guarantee promises to alleviate disruptions, the process of securing refunds is nuanced and requires quite a bit of effort from business owners.</p>
<br /><p>The most important thing for those who have contracts with DHL is to truly understand the DHL missing package and late delivery refund. Without a proper grasp of its complicated requirements, businesses are likely to leave refunds on the table.</p>
<br /><p>Just like industry counterparts UPS and FedEx, DHL provides its customers with a money-back guarantee to ensure satisfaction in the shipping process. This guarantee extends to cases where a DHL package is not delivered or is delivered later than expected. On the surface, DHL’s refund policy appears to be a reassuring safety net for businesses; however, the reality is that pursuing a refund can often become a complex and time-consuming process.</p>
<br /><p>For starters, there are some limits to the DHL services covered by the money-back guarantee. To be eligible for a DHL claim, the missing or delayed package must have been sent through one of the following services:</p>
<br /><p>The money-back guarantee represents an essential assurance for business owners who rely on DHL’s services to meet their shipping needs. It promises that compensation is on the table when expectations aren’t met due to late deliveries or lost packages. This can be particularly significant for time-sensitive deliveries or critical shipments impacting business operations.</p>
<br /><p>Nonetheless, the path to claiming a refund through DHL’s money-back guarantee isn’t always as straightforward as it may seem. DHL’s claims process is characterized by a tight time frame. For business professionals seeking a refund due to late delivery, the clock starts ticking from the moment the shipment is made. To be eligible for a DHL refund, customers are required to notify DHL of their claim within 14 calendar days from the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>The process involves several intricate steps that business owners must navigate, often demanding a certain level of familiarity with DHL’s specific procedures. In the fast-paced world of business, the time and effort required to file a claim can sometimes feel like an additional burden, diverting attention from core operations.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to the complicated DHL lost package process, the company also lists occasions in which their money-back guarantee is no longer valid. According to DHL’s website, some specific situations that are not covered include:</p>
<br /><p>In addition to these exceptions, the DHL refund only covers the rate charges for transportation costs only. It doesn’t include other charges such as fuel surcharges, fines, duties, taxes, levies, VAT, and other costs.</p>
<br /><p>After sorting through all those exceptions, we can see that DHL claims can only be filed in very specific situations. However, if a parcel you shipped with DHL shows up late or goes missing, and it is DHL’s fault, you can file a claim — and quickly. DHL claims must be filed within 14 days of the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>Streamlining the process of filing a claim with DHL for late delivery requires a systematic approach:</p>
<br /><p>As soon as you suspect a delay in your DHL shipment, initiate the claim process. Early action can make a substantial difference in the success of your claim.</p>
<br /><p>Before reaching out to DHL, gather all necessary information, including the account number, waybill number, shipment date, and recipient details. Having these details at hand expedites the process.</p>
<br /><p>To file a claim, the customer must contact DHL via writing or telephone. When contacting DHL, be concise and clear in your communication. Provide accurate and complete information to facilitate a swift resolution.</p>
<br /><p>Maintain records of all communication, including dates, times, and details discussed. These records serve as a valuable reference in case of any follow-up.</p>
<br /><p>If the idea of dedicating hours each month to auditing your invoices and claiming the funds that rightfully belong to you isn’t appealing, consider entrusting the task to the skilled small parcel auditors at P3 Cost Analysts. Our team specializes in examining small parcel invoices and ensuring you receive your rightful reimbursements.</p>
<br /><p>We conduct a thorough 45-point audit on each shipment, meticulously checking every detail to ensure you’re not missing out on any funds. Our proprietary software adds efficiency by automating the refund process, allowing you and your team to allocate your time and efforts toward more productive endeavors.</p>
<br /><p>Our track record often showcases savings of 20 to 25% on small parcel shipping expenses for our clients. The best part of opting for DHL’s shipping invoice audits is that you face no risks and incur no out-of-pocket costs. Instead, we operate on a simple principle: we share the refund credits we secure for your company, ensuring you receive the financial benefits you rightfully deserve.</p>
<br /><p>The process of filing a claim for a DHL package not delivered is specific and time-sensitive, but it’s also a crucial avenue for obtaining the refund you deserve for late deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>By adhering to DHL’s requirements, acting promptly, and ensuring accuracy, you can enhance your chances of navigating this process successfully. Keeping a watchful eye on the 14-day window and providing the requested details with precision will help you achieve a seamless and efficient resolution, ensuring your shipment concerns are addressed and your business remains on track.</p>

<br /><p>The post 12 Best Franchises for Women to Own in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>The post How Much Do Franchise Owners Really Make a Year? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>To shed light on this topic, we’re diving into data from Franchise Business Review, Glassdoor, Zippia, and ZipRecruiter to assess how much franchisees make on average and the potential yearly earnings one can expect.</p>
<br /><p>By analyzing average incomes across various industries and markets, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how much a franchise owner makes a year, guiding those interested in this path.</p>
<br /><p>The earning potential of franchise owners can vary widely, shaped by factors like industry, location, and individual business strategy, with reported salaries for franchise owners in the United States ranging from as low as $39,000 to as high as $204,800 annually. This range highlights the significant variability in income potential within the franchising world.</p>
<br /><p>Keep in mind these are just reported ranges of salaries. A franchise owner is a business owner, so they make money two different ways. One is by paying themselves a fair market salary for their services working for the company they own, and the second way they make money is if their business(a franchise in this case) makes a profit. If the franchise makes a profit, then the franchise owner makes money there as well.</p>
<br /><p>To better understand these differences, we’ve gathered data from various sources, providing a comprehensive overview of what franchise owners really earn across different contexts and scenarios.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review’s recent survey of nearly 30,000 franchisees offers valuable insights into the question, “How much do franchisees make?” The average annual income for franchise owners is reported at $107,119.</p>
<br /><p>Notably, franchise owners who have moved beyond the startup period, typically the first two years in business, see their average incomes increase to $118,792. This figure is significantly higher than the average salary of independent small business owners, which is $64,432 according to PayScale, showcasing a distinct advantage in the franchise model.</p>
<br /><p>The report also illustrates the impact of owning multiple franchise units. Franchisees operating a single unit report an average income of $90,200, while those with two to four units see their average annual incomes rise to $132,400. For franchise owners who expand their portfolio to five or more units, the average franchise owner salary escalates to an impressive $204,800.</p>
<br /><p>Glassdoor data sheds light on the earnings of franchise owners in the United States based on self-reported salary data. Their estimated total annual pay for a franchise owner is approximately $98,162. This information is based on Glassdoor’s proprietary Total Pay Estimate model, which draws from salaries reported by users plus extra pay, which can include bonuses, commissions, tips, and profit sharing. This extra pay can vary significantly depending on the specific pay models and profit-sharing structures of different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>The ‘Most Likely Range’ of total pay, falling within the 25th to 75th percentile of all reported data, spans from $74,000 to $137,000 annually. This detailed breakdown offers a realistic view of the average franchise owner salary, reflecting the varied compensation models across different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>According to Zippia, the average salary for a franchise owner in the United States is notably lower than other sources, at $49,588, with a typical range between $39,000 and $62,000 annually. Zippia further breaks down these figures by state, providing a regional perspective on franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>The lower figures reported by Zippia might be attributed to their data collection methodology, which includes a mix of employee self-reports, public internet data, and proprietary information from other companies. This blend of sources, while offering diverse insights, also introduces a potential for variance in accuracy, especially considering the self-reported nature of some data.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s state-by-state analysis of franchise owner salaries reveals that the national average salary is around $109,437, aligning more closely with other sources like Franchise Business Review. They provide a detailed regional breakdown, highlighting Minnesota as the top state with an average annual salary of $119,885 for franchise owners.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s methodology involves estimating compensation ranges for job listings where the employer does not state a pay range. This approach factors in the job title, location, and hiring company to generate their estimates.</p>
<br /><p>While these figures are based on a robust algorithm, it’s important for potential franchise owners to consider that these are estimates and may not completely align with the actual compensation range, which can fluctuate based on numerous factors.</p>
<br /><p>The Franchise Business Review report offers insight into the average salaries within various sectors, showcasing which industries may be the most profitable. Here’s a look at some key industries and their average franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>This sector includes companies that provide services to other businesses, such as consulting, marketing, and cost reduction services. These franchises often offer unique advantages, particularly in scalability and market demand. For instance, P3 Cost Analysts, a leader in cost reduction, combines strong market demand with a proven business model, making it an attractive option for those who want to work from home and scale without having to open multiple locations.</p>
<br /><p>Including a range of services like beauty, fitness, and cleaning, this industry caters directly to individual consumers. The high average salary reflects the consistent and growing consumer demand for personal services, driven by increasing disposable income and a focus on health and wellness.</p>
<br /><p>The senior care industry, significantly impacted by demographic trends such as an aging population, has seen a growing demand for elder care services. This sector includes a range of services like in-home care, nursing homes, senior living relocation services, and specialized healthcare. The high average salary in this industry reflects not only the essential nature of these services but also the expanding market as our population ages.</p>
<br /><p>The pet services industry, covering everything from grooming to pet daycare, capitalizes on the strong emotional bond people have with their pets. With increasing pet ownership and willingness to spend on pets, this industry has seen substantial growth, reflected in its attractive average salary.</p>
<br /><p>As you can see from the numbers above, the world of franchising offers a vast range of income potential. Due to this range, pinpointing an exact franchise owner salary can be challenging. However, there are several key factors that may determine how much franchise owners can earn.</p>
<br /><p>The geographic location of your franchise can significantly influence your earnings. Franchises situated in high-traffic areas or regions with a strong demand for your product or service tend to generate higher revenues and profits.</p>
<br /><p>The choice of industry can be a major driver of profitability. Some industries inherently yield higher profit margins than others, such as those listed above. For example, healthcare or specialized retail franchises may be harder to break into but often offer greater earning potential compared to highly competitive industries.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees with prior industry-specific experience may find it easier to adapt and operate efficiently. Experience can lead to better decision-making, streamlined operations, and a quicker return on investment, all contributing to higher earnings.</p>
<br /><p>The level of support and training provided by the franchisor can directly impact profitability. Franchise systems that offer comprehensive training programs, ongoing assistance, and marketing support enable franchisees to navigate challenges effectively and drive revenue growth.</p>
<br /><p>The royalty structure established by the franchisor is a critical factor in determining earnings. Higher royalty rates may reduce a franchisee’s profitability, while those with reasonable royalty fees can retain a larger share of their earnings, contributing to a healthier owner income.</p>
<br /><p>The number of franchise locations you operate can significantly influence your earnings. Owning multiple franchise units within the same or different franchise brands can offer several advantages in terms of profitability.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding these factors is essential for making informed decisions and when considering the average franchise owner salary.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review stands out as potentially the most reliable source, having directly surveyed nearly 30,000 franchisees. However, it’s important to acknowledge that their data, like the others, is self-reported. This aspect underscores the need for a cautious approach in interpreting these figures, as self-reported data can be subject to biases and individual variances.</p>
<br /><p>The ranges of franchise owner salaries reported by these sources are quite broad, highlighting the variability in earnings across the franchise industry. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the franchise’s location, the specific industry, and the operational efficiency of each franchise. Such variability suggests that prospective franchise owners should consider a wide array of factors when evaluating potential earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Despite differences in the numbers between sources like Zippia and ZipRecruiter, there is a consistent trend where franchise owners in the Northeast, West Coast, and Midwest regions generally report higher salaries. This geographical trend is a crucial consideration for potential franchisees, as it indicates that location can significantly influence the financial success of a franchise.</p>
<br /><p>While these data sources provide valuable insights into the potential earnings of franchise owners, they should be viewed within the broader context of the franchise industry. Earnings can be influenced by the type of franchise, its geographic location, and the individual performance of franchise owners. This understanding is essential for potential franchise owners, emphasizing the need to consider these estimates as part of a comprehensive research process before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The financial compensation for franchise owners is quite different from regular salaried employment. A franchise owner’s income primarily comes from the profits of the business, which is the revenue left after all operating costs are covered. These costs include not just typical business expenses like staffing, supplies, and property maintenance but also specific franchise-related fees.</p>
<br /><p>For instance, franchisees must pay initial buy-in fees to acquire the franchise rights and ongoing royalties, which are often a percentage of the gross sales or a fixed fee. These royalties can significantly impact the overall profitability, as they are a recurring expense directly tied to the business’s revenue.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to managing these financial aspects, franchise owners are heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which includes responsibilities like hiring and training staff, maintaining the property, and ensuring adherence to the franchisor’s standards. This hands-on management is crucial, especially in the initial years when the focus is on establishing the business and recovering the initial investment.</p>
<br /><p>It’s common for franchise owners not to see substantial personal income until the business becomes firmly established, which can take a couple of years. During this period, the franchise owner’s role is to ensure the stability and growth of the business, often putting their personal salary secondary to the needs of the franchise. This startup period can be minimized by proper research and planning when deciding on the most profitable franchise for you.</p>
<br /><p>Choosing the most profitable franchise requires careful consideration and thorough research. It’s not just about brand power but also understanding the finer details that contribute to long-term success. Here are key steps to guide you in this crucial decision-making process:</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs) are loaded with information important financial information about a franchise. They provide details on everything from the company’s legal and financial history to its operational requirements. Carefully comparing the FDDs of different franchises can reveal insights into their stability, growth potential, and potential owner income.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the cost structure of a franchise is vital. Franchise fees and ongoing royalties can vary significantly and will impact your profitability. Assess these costs in relation to the value and support the franchisor provides.</p>
<br /><p>The success of a franchise heavily depends on its location and the market it serves. Investigate local market demands, competition, and economic conditions to determine the most favorable locations for your franchise.</p>
<br /><p>A realistic grasp of the operating expenses is crucial. This includes costs like rent, utilities, staffing, and inventory. Knowing these will help you calculate potential profit margins and manage cash flow effectively.</p>
<br /><p>The level of training and support a franchisor offers can greatly influence your success. Look for franchises that provide comprehensive training programs, marketing support, and ongoing assistance, as these can play a critical role in navigating challenges and driving growth.</p>
<br /><p>P3 Cost Analysts stands out as a highly attractive franchise opportunity, especially for those seeking a competitive franchise owner salary. Unlike other franchises that require multiple units for revenue growth, P3 can easily be scaled without additional locations.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees benefit from low operating expenses and the ability to operate remotely in any U.S. market. All franchisees are backed by strong franchisor support. This includes comprehensive training and access to a team of industry experts, ensuring a smooth start and ongoing success.</p>
<br /><p>The core of P3’s model is helping businesses save on recurring costs, creating a win-win scenario where franchisees share in the savings they identify for clients.

<br /><p>The post What Is MRO Procurement? + How to Optimize MRO Spending appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>If not carefully managed, MRO spending can become a financial burden for organizations of all types and sizes. However, where there are expenses, there’s also an opportunity for cost-saving measures to improve the bottom line. In this blog, we’ll look into the world of MRO procurement, uncovering the vital role it plays in businesses and how effectively managing it can be the key to financial stability and growth.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing, also known as MRO procurement, is the process of acquiring goods and services necessary for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of a business. MRO, which stands for Maintenance, Repair, and Operations, is a vital component of indirect procurement, which deals with non-production-related expenses. These purchases cover a broad spectrum of items essential to keep a company’s operations running smoothly.</p>
<br /><p>In certain industries, such as healthcare, there’s a greater emphasis on indirect procurement, including MRO purchasing, versus direct procurement. This emphasis stems from the fact that these service-based industries heavily rely on the continuous functionality of equipment and facilities. In contrast, manufacturing industries may place more emphasis on direct procurement, focusing on sourcing materials directly related to their production processes.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing encompasses a wide variety of procurement needs that are essential to the smooth and uninterrupted operation of a company. These MRO purchases can be conveniently categorized into three primary groups, each serving a distinct role in ensuring the seamless operation of a company:</p>
<br /><p>This category of MRO purchases primarily focuses on items necessary for the routine upkeep and maintenance of machinery, equipment, and facilities. It includes a range of components and supplies, such as:</p>
<br /><p>The repairs category of MRO purchases encompasses items and resources required for addressing unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions in machinery and equipment. It includes:</p>
<br /><p>The final category of MRO purchases — operations — covers services and supplies essential for the daily functioning of a business. This category includes items such as:</p>
<br /><p>Companies often face a series of challenges in the MRO procurement process, each with the potential to impact their bottom line and overall operational efficiency significantly.</p>
<br /><p>In many organizations, MRO procurement tends to be decentralized, with different departments or locations independently managing their needs. This separation can lead to inefficiencies as it often results in duplicate orders, missed opportunities for bulk purchasing discounts, and a lack of visibility into overall spending. Consequently, businesses may experience increased costs that could have been avoided with a more centralized and streamlined procurement approach.</p>
<br /><p>The complexity of managing a wide range of MRO suppliers is a common issue. Sourcing various parts, equipment, and services from multiple suppliers can become time-consuming and overwhelming. Furthermore, dealing with numerous suppliers can lead to inconsistent service levels, making it challenging to maintain reliable and efficient supply chains.</p>
<br /><p>Effective inventory control in MRO procurement is an ongoing struggle for many companies. Finding the right balance between maintaining adequate stock levels to ensure operational continuity and minimizing carrying costs is a constant challenge. Overstocked inventories tie up capital and storage space, while understocked inventories can lead to costly production disruptions. Striking this balance requires careful planning, forecasting, and demand management.</p>
<br /><p>Some MRO components are highly specialized and only needed at specific times. Managing the procurement of such specialized items can be challenging, as it requires predicting when and where these components will be required. Failing to anticipate these needs accurately can result in delays, increased downtime, and higher costs.</p>
<br /><p>To effectively manage MRO spend, businesses employ a range of strategic approaches tailored to their unique needs and challenges:</p>
<br /><p>The implementation of advanced procurement software and tools is essential in MRO strategy. These technological solutions offer enhanced visibility into procurement processes, allowing businesses to track orders, monitor inventory levels, and identify cost-saving opportunities. By leveraging technology, companies gain greater control over their MRO spend, reduce manual administrative tasks, and enhance overall efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>Many companies find value in streamlining their supplier base when it comes to MRO procurement. By reducing the number of MRO suppliers, organizations simplify supplier management, negotiation processes, and administrative tasks. This consolidation not only enhances efficiency but can also lead to better pricing agreements through increased purchasing volume.</p>
<br /><p>Leveraging data analytics has become a critical aspect of modern MRO strategy. By harnessing the power of data, businesses can make informed procurement decisions, optimize inventory levels, and anticipate future needs more accurately. Data-driven insights enable proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and mitigating the risk of emergency procurements that can be costly. Additionally, data analytics help identify trends, anomalies, and areas for cost savings within the MRO procurement process.</p>
<br /><p>One of the most effective approaches to MRO strategy is centralizing procurement. By consolidating the responsibility for MRO purchasing, companies can achieve greater consistency, better coordination, and improved cost control. Centralization fosters better alignment between departments, ensuring that MRO purchases meet the specific needs of each function. This collaborative approach enhances communication, streamlines decision-making, and ultimately results in more effective and cost-conscious procurement practices.</p>
<br /><p>These strategies collectively empower businesses to take a proactive approach to managing their MRO spend, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring the seamless operation of their facilities and equipment.</p>

This is where partnering with a specialized cost reduction consulting firm like P3 Cost Analysts becomes your strategic advantage.</p>

<br /><p>Instead of being tied down to a physical location, starting an online franchise allows you to essentially work from anywhere that has an internet connection. This could be a home office, coffee shop, hotel room, or any other destination you wish to work from.</p>
<br /><p>Some franchises will require you to work in the field or meet up with clients from time to time, but you’ll have the flexibility to schedule these meetings on your own time.</p>
<br /><p>This freedom of designing your schedule can be quite liberating. Whether you are a parent, caretaker, or simply have other responsibilities outside of work, starting a home-based franchise will allow you to create a life that fits your needs.</p>
<br /><p>Most online franchises require minimal employees for you to manage, while others can be run completely by yourself. Some may allow you to start out as the only operator and, once you scale and get more comfortable with the business, it would make sense to bring on the employees that you need. In all cases though, online franchises typically have management training or systems to help you manage these employees effectively.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, most online franchises have little overhead in comparison with their non-online counterparts. When you think of how employee- and cost-intensive retail or food franchises are, it makes sense for most people to run an online business.</p>
<br /><p>For a lot of work-from-home franchises, the clientele you work with will be recurring and therefore allow you to bring in predictable income. Also, depending on the type of service you offer, it might not take a ton of clients to actually meet your profit goals. Franchises with recurring revenue are especially great for those that want to work part-time while still retaining clients month after month.</p>
<br /><p>With many online franchises, you’re able to pull clients from all across the country or even the world. This allows you to scale much bigger and quicker than if you were tied down to a physical space in your local community. Furthermore, since your online business can be open 24/7, people can reach out or purchase services even while you’re sleeping.</p>

<br /><p>The post DHL Refund Claims: Leaving Money on the Table? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>The most important thing for those who have contracts with DHL is to truly understand the DHL missing package and late delivery refund. Without a proper grasp of its complicated requirements, businesses are likely to leave refunds on the table.</p>
<br /><p>Just like industry counterparts UPS and FedEx, DHL provides its customers with a money-back guarantee to ensure satisfaction in the shipping process. This guarantee extends to cases where a DHL package is not delivered or is delivered later than expected. On the surface, DHL’s refund policy appears to be a reassuring safety net for businesses; however, the reality is that pursuing a refund can often become a complex and time-consuming process.</p>
<br /><p>For starters, there are some limits to the DHL services covered by the money-back guarantee. To be eligible for a DHL claim, the missing or delayed package must have been sent through one of the following services:</p>
<br /><p>The money-back guarantee represents an essential assurance for business owners who rely on DHL’s services to meet their shipping needs. It promises that compensation is on the table when expectations aren’t met due to late deliveries or lost packages. This can be particularly significant for time-sensitive deliveries or critical shipments impacting business operations.</p>
<br /><p>Nonetheless, the path to claiming a refund through DHL’s money-back guarantee isn’t always as straightforward as it may seem. DHL’s claims process is characterized by a tight time frame. For business professionals seeking a refund due to late delivery, the clock starts ticking from the moment the shipment is made. To be eligible for a DHL refund, customers are required to notify DHL of their claim within 14 calendar days from the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>The process involves several intricate steps that business owners must navigate, often demanding a certain level of familiarity with DHL’s specific procedures. In the fast-paced world of business, the time and effort required to file a claim can sometimes feel like an additional burden, diverting attention from core operations.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to the complicated DHL lost package process, the company also lists occasions in which their money-back guarantee is no longer valid. According to DHL’s website, some specific situations that are not covered include:</p>
<br /><p>In addition to these exceptions, the DHL refund only covers the rate charges for transportation costs only. It doesn’t include other charges such as fuel surcharges, fines, duties, taxes, levies, VAT, and other costs.</p>
<br /><p>After sorting through all those exceptions, we can see that DHL claims can only be filed in very specific situations. However, if a parcel you shipped with DHL shows up late or goes missing, and it is DHL’s fault, you can file a claim — and quickly. DHL claims must be filed within 14 days of the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>Streamlining the process of filing a claim with DHL for late delivery requires a systematic approach:</p>
<br /><p>As soon as you suspect a delay in your DHL shipment, initiate the claim process. Early action can make a substantial difference in the success of your claim.</p>
<br /><p>Before reaching out to DHL, gather all necessary information, including the account number, waybill number, shipment date, and recipient details. Having these details at hand expedites the process.</p>
<br /><p>To file a claim, the customer must contact DHL via writing or telephone. When contacting DHL, be concise and clear in your communication. Provide accurate and complete information to facilitate a swift resolution.</p>
<br /><p>Maintain records of all communication, including dates, times, and details discussed. These records serve as a valuable reference in case of any follow-up.</p>
<br /><p>If the idea of dedicating hours each month to auditing your invoices and claiming the funds that rightfully belong to you isn’t appealing, consider entrusting the task to the skilled small parcel auditors at P3 Cost Analysts. Our team specializes in examining small parcel invoices and ensuring you receive your rightful reimbursements.</p>
<br /><p>We conduct a thorough 45-point audit on each shipment, meticulously checking every detail to ensure you’re not missing out on any funds. Our proprietary software adds efficiency by automating the refund process, allowing you and your team to allocate your time and efforts toward more productive endeavors.</p>
<br /><p>Our track record often showcases savings of 20 to 25% on small parcel shipping expenses for our clients. The best part of opting for DHL’s shipping invoice audits is that you face no risks and incur no out-of-pocket costs. Instead, we operate on a simple principle: we share the refund credits we secure for your company, ensuring you receive the financial benefits you rightfully deserve.</p>
<br /><p>The process of filing a claim for a DHL package not delivered is specific and time-sensitive, but it’s also a crucial avenue for obtaining the refund you deserve for late deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>By adhering to DHL’s requirements, acting promptly, and ensuring accuracy, you can enhance your chances of navigating this process successfully. Keeping a watchful eye on the 14-day window and providing the requested details with precision will help you achieve a seamless and efficient resolution, ensuring your shipment concerns are addressed and your business remains on track.</p>

<br /><p>The post 8 HP Competitors and Alternatives for MPS appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Hewlett Packard (HP) is a major player in the printing domain. They’ve built a reputation for delivering quality products over the years and are a go-to for many in managed printing services. However, it’s worth noting that size and reputation don’t always translate to the best fit for every business’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Today, we will take a closer look at HP’s managed print services, their top competitors, and how your business can save money on printing.</p>
<br /><p>While HP is known for its wide array of products and services, there’s no shortage of competitors that offer very similar features. While MPS aims to save businesses money on printing, some major issues in the industry plague their effectiveness.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you’re working with HP or one of its competitors, you’re likely to run into one of the following issues:</p>
<br /><p>Many clients face billing discrepancies and lack transparency in the charges levied by major print and copier providers. The overcharges and hidden costs can lead to businesses paying more than they should.</p>
<br /><p>The standard terms and conditions in MPS contracts often favor the vendor, exposing the client to potential pitfalls. These unfavorable conditions highlight the importance of renegotiating terms to better protect the client’s interests.</p>
<br /><p>While businesses spend substantially on their print and copier services, they often don’t receive the promised service. Frequent equipment downtimes, poor support, and an overall lack of management can negatively affect a company’s operations.</p>
<br /><p>Many MPS programs are overly intricate, leading to wasted time and inefficiency for organizations. Clients are searching for programs that are not only cost-effective but also simple to understand and manage.</p>
<br /><p>With businesses spending millions on printing services annually, there’s a clear opportunity to find cost-saving solutions. While you may consider switching to one of the competitors on our list, there are other alternatives as well. For example, the quickest and most straightforward way to save money is by consulting with a company that specializes in auditing MPS invoices, such as P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>A strategic review can be immensely beneficial for businesses already utilizing managed print services, especially those whose monthly lease and print expenses exceed $10,000. Engaging with specialized MPS auditing and consulting services can shine a light on the inefficiencies, helping you navigate the contractual complexities and identifying considerable savings.</p>
<br /><p>In addition, if you’re looking for alternatives to the common players in the market, there are more tailored solutions that align with individual business objectives. Opting for consultancy is the step that transitions your print management from merely functional to optimal.</p>
<br /><p>As one of the top HP competitors in the world, Canon is known for bringing new and exciting approaches to the print and copier industry.

In comparison to other HP printer competitors, Ricoh offers a more cost-effective solution without compromising performance. This emphasis on value-for-money, combined with their historical innovation in the industry, positions Ricoh as a strong HP competitor in the market.</p>

Their Managed Print Services go beyond just providing equipment; it covers supplies, maintenance, and actual usage costs. This comprehensive approach helps companies identify hidden expenses and streamline operations.</p>
<br /><p>A notable HP competitor from the US, Xerox, has been a fixture in the print industry for over a century. Originating with the development of the first plain paper photocopier, they’ve diversified into a wide range of services, including digital printing and managed print services. Their offerings, recognized for performance and cost-efficiency, present businesses with a strong HP printer alternative. With a commitment to innovation and a global footprint, Xerox stands as a formidable choice for those evaluating their print solutions.</p>

Catering to business and personal printing needs, Lexmark offers a range of printers and imaging products emphasizing durability and efficiency. Their commitment to sustainability and high-quality printing solutions makes them one of the best HP printer competitors for businesses around the globe. As a younger yet impactful player in the industry, Lexmark continues to be a choice worthy of consideration for those keen on optimizing their printing operations.</p>

With its extensive history in innovation, Toshiba has developed a rich portfolio of printing solutions tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses globally.

<br /><p>The post Telecom Managed Service Companies: Are They Worth It? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>So, what exactly are telecommunications managed services? Their definition and scope are ever-changing. This article offers a comprehensive look into the various components of managed telecom services. We’ll break down their functionalities, the key benefits they offer, and the alternative approaches businesses might consider.</p>
<br /><p>Keep reading to explore the role these services play in the modern business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Managed Telecom Services involve outsourcing the management and maintenance of an organization’s telecommunications infrastructure to a third-party provider. The primary objective is to let businesses concentrate on their core competencies, ensuring their telecommunications requirements are in the hands of seasoned professionals.</p>
<br /><p>Given the astonishing rate at which technology is advancing today, the role of an in-house IT department is intensifying. Keeping up with daily technological advancements is not just challenging, but it’s quickly becoming a full-time job in itself. As more and more businesses integrate high-tech solutions into their operations, the demands on the IT department build up.</p>
<br /><p>The quest for secure, reliable, and efficient connections has never been so critical. Now, when almost every business operation hinges on technology, ensuring a highly functioning telecommunications system is crucial. It’s amidst these challenges that businesses increasingly turn to Managed Telecom Services as a solution to streamline, secure, and enhance their communications infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>In an age where effective communication is the cornerstone of business success, understanding the services offered by telecom management professionals is essential. Let’s dive into the specifics of what telecom managed service providers bring to the table:</p>
<br /><p>Networks form the backbone of modern telecommunications. Managed network services ensure that both voice and data networks operate smoothly, with minimal downtime and optimal performance.</p>
<br /><p>Data drives decisions in the modern business landscape. These services encompass the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data, ensuring businesses have access to critical information when needed.</p>
<br /><p>From traditional phone lines to cutting-edge VoIP and unified communications, managed communication services ensure businesses can communicate internally and externally without any hitches.</p>
<br /><p>Managing mobile devices, apps, and networks is crucial with the rise of remote work and the need for on-the-go connectivity. These services help businesses stay connected, no matter where they are.</p>
<br /><p>Data centers are the heart of many organizations, hosting critical applications and data. These services oversee the infrastructure, ensuring high availability and performance.</p>
<br /><p>In an era of rising cyber threats, securing telecommunication infrastructures is paramount. Managed security services provide continuous monitoring, threat detection, and response measures to safeguard assets.</p>
<br /><p>The hardware that forms the foundation of telecommunications shouldn’t be overlooked. Managed IT equipment services take care of maintaining, updating, and ensuring that devices like routers, switches, servers, and other crucial components operate optimally.</p>
<br /><p>Software drives many of the functions in telecom networks, from routing calls to ensuring data security. Managed software services ensure that all software components are up-to-date, bug-free, and tailored to the organization’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring a blend of expertise, state-of-the-art tools, and proactive methodologies, offering businesses an edge in a competitive landscape. Here are some of the compelling advantages of this partnership:</p>
<br /><p>By partnering with a managed service provider, organizations can achieve significant cost savings. Instead of sustaining the expenses of an extensive in-house team or constantly updating technology, businesses can leverage the economies of scale provided by these experts.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring expertise that helps streamline telecom operations. Their proficiency eliminates unnecessary complexities, allowing businesses to function more smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<br /><p>With the technical aspects of IT and telecommunications managed externally, internal staff can center their efforts on the organization’s core objectives. This focus ensures that staff productivity remains high and is unhampered by tech-related distractions.</p>
<br /><p>Outsourcing management means issues like compatibility across cloud applications, performance challenges, and rapid service development are taken care of by the service provider. Organizations can thus remain confident in the reliability and scalability of their tech infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers offer solutions tailored to the unique requirements and goals of each business. This customization ensures that the technology infrastructure and services align perfectly with the organization’s objectives.</p>
<br /><p>Constant oversight is a hallmark of professionally managed service providers. They not only provide 24/7 monitoring but also offer insights through regular performance tracking, enabling informed strategic decision-making.</p>
<br /><p>There is another side to the coin. Telecom managed service providers come with their own set of expenses. So, what’s the alternative? Cost reduction firms like P3 Cost Analysts specialize in telecom auditing, finding discrepancies in billing, and ensuring businesses only pay for what they use. Here’s what P3 brings to the table:</p>
<br /><p>The P3 model focuses on transparency and saving money rather than additional expenses. For businesses tight on budget or looking for efficiency, P3 provides a compelling alternative.</p>
<br /><p>Take, for instance, a recent case study involving a school system. Despite the client paying optimal rates, P3 identified a billing error that had persisted for years. Upon extensive negotiation, the client was rewarded with a hefty refund check of $150,000 and a monthly bill reduction of over $3,000.</p>
<br /><p>This scenario underscores P3’s diligent commitment to ensuring clients are only billed for what they should be.</p>
<br /><p>In our exploration of Telecom Managed Services, we’ve seen how they present a comprehensive solution for businesses, addressing every aspect of telecommunication needs. These services offer an array of benefits, from streamlining operations to enhancing technological infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>While these advantages are clear, it’s crucial for organizations to assess their unique needs and financial landscape. Many will find that the financial inspection provided by a telecom audit company, such as P3 Cost Analysts, aligns more seamlessly with their end goals.</p>

<br /><p>In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at one of the key components in determining if a franchise opportunity will work for you – liquid capital. Understanding the concept of liquid capital, how much you need, and how to get it for your franchise is crucial to start your entrepreneurial journey. So, let’s dive into the details!</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital, often referred to as liquid assets, is any asset that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without losing its value. In regards to opening a franchise, liquid capital is essentially your ready-to-use funds that can be utilized immediately for any necessary expenses.</p>
<br /><p>So, what does liquid capital mean for potential franchisees? It’s easy to confuse liquid capital with the amount due to the franchisor. While the total liquid capital required for a franchisee certainly encompasses costs to cover the franchise fee, it also extends to other startup expenses necessary to kickstart the business. These costs may include rent or real estate, training, inventory, and additional overheads.</p>
<br /><p>Another common misconception among franchisees is thinking that liquid capital and net worth are the same thing. Net worth is the cumulative total of both liquid (easily convertible to cash) and illiquid assets (assets that are not readily convertible to cash). In contrast, liquid capital, as highlighted in the examples below, includes only those assets that can be swiftly converted into cash.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the difference between liquid capital and net worth is crucial when planning your franchise investment. More importantly, it helps you guarantee that you can meet the minimum liquid capital requirements of the franchise opportunity you’re interested in.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to acquiring a franchise, potential franchisees should be aware of various sources of liquid capital at their disposal. Let’s look at some of the most common examples.</p>
<br /><p>At the top of the list of liquid capital examples is cash or the balance you have in your savings account. This cash can be quickly and easily used for any immediate business needs.</p>
<br /><p>Stocks, bonds, and other marketable securities also qualify as liquid capital. Their value lies in their marketability – they can be sold on the stock exchange, providing a quick influx of cash when required. However, it’s important to remember that the selling price is dependent on the market conditions at the time of sale.</p>
<br /><p>Mutual funds, essentially pools of diversified investments, constitute another form of liquid capital. Despite the complexity of these investments, they can typically be sold within a few business days, transforming into cash at hand.</p>
<br /><p>Similar to mutual funds, money market funds are a type of investment fund. They are considered highly liquid due to their short-term nature. This allows for quick conversion to cash, further adding to your liquid capital.</p>
<br /><p>While understanding what counts as liquid capital is integral to your franchise investment journey, it’s equally important to recognize non-liquid assets. Non-liquid capital refers to assets that cannot be quickly converted into cash without potentially losing value. Here are some common examples:</p>
<br /><p>Properties, whether residential or commercial, fall under the category of non-liquid capital. Despite their considerable value, they can’t be quickly or easily sold without the risk of a price drop. Real estate transactions can take weeks or even months to complete, which doesn’t offer the immediate accessibility that liquid capital does.</p>
<br /><p>Items like art, antiques, rare coins, or other collectibles are also considered non-liquid capital. While they may hold value, finding a buyer willing to pay that value can be a time-consuming process, making them a less optimal source of capital.</p>
<br /><p>Machinery, vehicles, or other equipment related to your business or personal use are also forms of non-liquid capital. Although these assets might be highly valuable, selling them for their true worth could be challenging and time-consuming, hence their classification as non-liquid.</p>
<br /><p>For individuals below retirement age, retirement accounts generally fall under non-liquid assets. Despite their substantial value, accessing these funds early can invite penalties and tax implications, making them less ideal as a source of liquid capital for a franchise investment.</p>
<br /><p>Potential investors often focus on the initial franchise fee when considering buying a franchise. However, the financial aspect of owning a franchise extends far beyond this initial payment. Franchises generally set a minimum liquid capital requirement for potential franchisees. This ensures that they possess the requisite financial backing, not just for the initial purchase but also to sustain the franchise until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>The term “liquid capital” might vary in definition across franchises. Some may have a more expansive interpretation of what assets count as liquid, while others might be more restrictive. It’s essential to thoroughly understand and align with the specific definitions set by the franchise you’re considering by reading over the Franchise Disclosure Document.</p>
<br /><p>Beyond the initial investment, franchises come with various startup costs, from leasing space and acquiring inventory to training staff and launching marketing initiatives. Furthermore, achieving profitability in a new business doesn’t happen overnight. There might be a period where expenses surpass revenue, especially in the initial stages. During such times, liquid capital acts as a financial safety net, ensuring the business can continue its operations uninterrupted. It provides the franchisee with a buffer to navigate early challenges, making it a crucial aspect of the franchising journey.</p>
<br /><p>In general, most franchises will have a minimum requirement of $50,000 in liquid assets. However, some demand much more. For instance, the P3 Cost Analysts franchise has a relatively low cash minimum of $59,500. Meanwhile, other franchise opportunities will differ. KFC, for example, requires potential franchisees to have $750,000 in liquid assets.</p>
<br /><p>However, it’s essential to ensure that diving into a franchise doesn’t put you in a bad spot financially. Maintaining a cushion for personal expenses and unforeseen business challenges is crucial. Though thorough research and due diligence can help in selecting a promising franchise, there’s an inherent risk in starting a business. Therefore, it’s wise to ensure you have enough liquid capital in reserve to pay personal bills and expenses during the initial phases when profitability might not be immediate.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you are planning to buy a franchise or are just starting your research, you might be wondering, “How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?” If your money isn’t easily accessible in your savings accounts, you may have convertible assets that can add to your total available. Here are a few options to consider:</p>
<br /><p>This is the most straightforward way to accumulate liquid capital. By saving a portion of your income over time, you can build up your liquid capital reserves without borrowing or selling assets.</p>
<br /><p>If you have personal assets such as valuable collectibles or equipment, you could sell these to generate liquid capital. However, this should be done with caution as it could have tax implications and also reduce your net worth.</p>
<br /><p>Tapping into your home’s equity through a HELOC can provide ready funds. As you repay your mortgage and your property’s value increases, you accumulate equity, which can be borrowed against for liquid capital. This option often has lower interest rates than other loans, but remember, your home serves as the collateral. If you can’t pay back the loan, you risk losing your property.</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, you might have family members or friends willing to invest in your franchise business. However, this option should be approached carefully to avoid any future disagreements or strained relationships.</p>
<br /><p>How does liquid capital work?</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital refers to assets that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without significant loss in value. In the context of business, it represents readily available funds that can be used to cover immediate and short-term needs, such as payroll, rent, and inventory.</p>
<br /><p>How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Two common ways to gather liquid capital for a franchise include tapping into personal savings or selling personal assets, such as stocks, collectibles, or valuable equipment.</p>
<br /><p>Is a 401k considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>While a 401k holds value and can be accessed, it’s not typically classified as liquid capital because withdrawing funds early can result in penalties and tax consequences. However, using strategies like Rollover for Business Startups (ROBS), individuals can tap into their 401k to finance a franchise without penalties.</p>
<br /><p>Is a loan considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>Some franchisors do not regard borrowed money as liquid capital. This is because loans come with the obligation of repayment, which can impact the financial stability of the franchisee.</p>
<br /><p>Is a house a liquid asset?</p>
<br /><p>Generally, a house is a non-liquid asset. Selling it to convert it into cash can be time-consuming and depends on current market conditions.</p>
<br /><p>How to get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Acquiring liquid assets can be done by building up personal savings over time or by selling personal assets like stocks or collectibles.</p>

<br /><p>The post Are Franchises a Good Investment? (Hint: It Depends) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s cut through the noise and look into the practical aspects of franchising, examining the potential rewards, risks, and factors determining whether owning a franchise is profitable.</p>
<br /><p>A franchise is a business arrangement where an individual (franchisee) is granted the right to operate a business using an established company’s branding, products, and services (franchisor). This arrangement forms a partnership between the two parties, allowing the franchisee to replicate a proven business model with the guidance and support of the franchisor. Some common franchises that you’ve surely seen in your day-to-day life include 711 and Subway.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike starting a business from scratch, where there are many uncertainties and challenges, a franchise presents a more calculated investment. The franchisor’s track record, successful business practices, and standardized systems significantly reduce some of the inherent risks of entrepreneurship. Investors are essentially tapping into a model that has already demonstrated its viability, making the endeavor a strategic combination of investment and business pursuit.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees earn money by selling products and services within their franchised business. While sales are the primary income source, the process involves additional financial components. For instance, franchise owners pay the franchisor a franchise fee and ongoing royalties. Operating a business comes with its own set of costs as well. After accounting for all these factors, franchisees typically see a portion of the profit as their earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise costs vary widely depending on the brand, industry, and scale of the business. The initial investment encompasses the franchise fee, which could be as low as $10,000 for smaller, home-based franchises and can exceed $2 million for well-established and prominent brands.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, there are other startup expenses such as equipment, inventory, and location setup. It’s crucial to thoroughly review the franchise’s Financial Disclosure Document (FDD) to understand all costs involved before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The FDD can also help potential franchisees get a better idea of the possible return on investment (ROI) of the franchise. For example, some franchises, like McDonald’s, may require startup costs over $1 million. However, their potential for profit is also relatively high.</p>
<br /><p>Alternatively, entrepreneurs may opt for a franchise with lower initial costs but potentially similar ROI as McDonald’s.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can indeed be a wise investment decision, particularly due to their array of inherent advantages that mitigate risks and increase the potential for profitability.</p>
<br /><p>The allure of a franchise lies in its established and proven business model. Franchisors have fine-tuned their operations over time, optimizing strategies that have shown success across various locations. This proven blueprint provides franchisees with a head start, allowing them to bypass the uncertainties and trial-and-error typically associated with starting an independent business.</p>
<br /><p>A significant hurdle for new businesses is building brand recognition and trust. Franchises overcome this challenge by offering franchisees immediate access to a widely recognized and trusted brand. This brand recognition can significantly reduce the time and effort required to attract customers and establish a foothold in the market.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike independent startups, franchisees benefit from a network of resources, ongoing support, and comprehensive training provided by the franchisor. This support extends from initial setup to daily operations, guiding franchisees through challenges and helping them navigate the business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Franchises often pool resources for marketing and advertising campaigns. This collective effort boosts brand visibility and customer engagement, benefiting all franchisees within the network. Such campaigns can encompass anything from national TV advertisements to local social media initiatives.</p>
<br /><p>While franchises offer these compelling benefits, it’s important to remember that each investment decision should be well-informed and aligned with individual goals and circumstances. Thorough research, careful consideration, and seeking professional advice will help potential franchisees to decide if franchising is worth it for them.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can be profitable, but profitability depends on various factors such as the industry, location, management, the franchisee, and the specific franchise itself. Thorough research, adaptability, and a keen understanding of the local landscape are pivotal in transforming the potential for profit into reality within the world of franchising.</p>
<br /><p>While there are so many factors at play, it’s impossible to give an exact number for the potential income of a franchise owner. Franchisors won’t make any profitability promises to avoid potential litigation down the line. They may, however, offer information on the financial performance of other franchise locations.</p>
<br /><p>According to Top Franchise, the average annual income for typical franchisees is around $80,000 before factoring in taxes and expenses. While a minority of franchise owners exceed $200,000 in yearly earnings, a majority earn approximately $50,000. Of course, the profitability can vary based on your industry.</p>
<br /><p>Making the decision to invest in a franchise is a significant step toward entrepreneurship. While franchises offer a host of benefits, it’s crucial to navigate this path with strategic planning. The following are some of the essential factors to focus on when considering “Are franchises worth it?”</p>
<br /><p>When considering a franchise, align your choice with your personal strengths and passions. Your commitment and enthusiasm are crucial for long-term success. Choose a franchise that resonates with your skills and interests, increasing your chances of dedicated involvement.</p>
<br /><p>Conduct thorough market research to assess the demand for the franchise’s products or services in your chosen location. Analyzing the competition, demographics, and market trends will provide valuable insights into the potential for success.</p>
<br /><p>Evaluate your financial readiness to invest in a franchise. Beyond the initial investment, consider working capital, ongoing royalties, and operational costs. Financial planning is key to sustaining the business until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>Research the franchisor’s reputation within the industry and among franchisees. Speak with existing franchisees to gather insights into their experiences. A reputable franchisor is more likely to provide the support and resources necessary for success.</p>
<br /><p>Based on the considerations above, one should look at the P3 Cost Analysts franchise opportunity as a perfect gateway to business ownership. With a modest startup investment of just $59,500, you can step into a world of untapped earning potential.</p>

<br /><p>The goal is obviously a low-cost franchise with high-profit returns, so to choose one you need to check off some boxes to ensure the franchise you decide on has the best possible chance of success.</p>
<br /><p>Make sure the franchisor has a proven support system for franchisees, specifically with regards to marketing because that is what will make or break your business.</p>
<br /><p>For example, does the franchisor advertise the brand? Do they make it easy for people to know about the business?</p>
<br /><p>The marketing and brand are what you are paying for most, so it is critical that they’ve mastered this particular aspect. The marketing they do for the brand as a whole is of the utmost importance, as well as the support they give to franchisees, otherwise, you are wasting your money by investing in a franchise business instead of starting up from scratch.</p>
<br /><p>It is important to know if there is a demand for the products or services they sell, and if products or services are offered in specific locations, is there a demand for them there?</p>
<br /><p>The product could be exceptional, but there is a possibility that if it’s in the wrong location, the business could flop. Request this information from the franchisor. Another good way of determining demand is by doing a simple Google Trends search to find out if people in the area are searching for those products.</p>
<br /><p>It’s also a good idea to analyze the competition for the product or service—that may give you a good idea of what it takes to be successful.</p>
<br /><p>Check nationwide the number of locations and annual revenue. It may also be a good idea to have some conversations with other franchisees.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Direct offers another valuable tip: the best way to determine a franchise’s future profitability is by analyzing Item 19 of the franchise’s FDD (franchise disclosure document), which outlines the business’s financial performance. It may be beneficial to consult an accountant or lawyer to fully understand this.</p>
<br /><p>Only consider the franchises whose initial fee and upfront investments are realistic for your current financial situation; this may be another discussion to have with an accountant or lawyer.</p>
<br /><p>There may be hidden costs, personal financial necessities, or royalties, so reading the fine print is essential.</p>
<br /><p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly: Is what’s required of you something you will enjoy doing, and do you believe in the core offering? For most people, using their top skills is what’s going to fulfill them on a daily basis.</p>
<br /><p>Armed with this knowledge, there are several franchises that meet the above requirements and are also low-investment, high-return franchises.</p>
<br /><p>Every entrepreneur aims for a high return on investment (ROI) when stepping into the business world. While initiating a venture from scratch offers a certain allure, franchising often presents a more secure route to achieving that desired high ROI with lower startup costs. With the foundation of a proven system and established methodologies, a franchise can significantly amplify your potential returns.</p>

<br /><p>The post Top 10 Recession-Proof Businesses in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Savvy entrepreneurs understand that waiting for the “perfect” moment to start a business is futile. A better tactic is to opt for a company that can withstand the test of time and economic downturns by choosing recession-proof industries.</p>
<br /><p>In this blog, we’ll explore ten recession-proof business ideas that can offer the potential for lasting success and stability, regardless of the economic climate. Let’s dive into these opportunities and discover how specific businesses that do well in a recession can provide peace of mind for entrepreneurs in both prosperous and challenging times.</p>
<br /><p>A recession-proof business is one that is not as heavily impacted by the economic effects of a recession, typically stemming from industries that provide basic needs. Because they offer needed products and services, they are the last industries to be affected by changes in consumer spending.</p>
<br /><p>To be clear, there is no such thing as a fully recession-proof business. Every recession is completely different and impossible to predict. For example, the real estate market crashed in 2008 but actually thrived during the early 2000s recession. However, some recession-proof industries are much more likely to weather the storm, regardless of what causes the economy to falter.</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses are those found in sectors that thrive even during economic downturns, such as:</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses typically cater to non-negotiable needs, offering products or services that people cannot easily forgo. By providing essential solutions, these businesses ensure their relevance and demand even during economic downturns.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, sustaining affordable prices plays a crucial role in their resilience during challenging times. When consumers become more budget-conscious in recessions, businesses offering competitive pricing are generally better positioned to retain customers and maintain a steady revenue stream.</p>
<br /><p>Regardless of how the economy looks when you decide to start your own business, setting yourself up with a recession-proof business is a solid plan. You never know what the future holds, and these business ideas can give you some assurance now and for years to come.</p>
<br /><p>The automotive services industry includes all post-purchase services necessary to keep a car in working order, such as oil changes, tire repairs, air conditioning, electrical inspections, plus body repair, painting, and much more.</p>
<br /><p>The market is expected to register a 3 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years and reach a value of $76.91 billion by 2027.</p>
<br /><p>If people aren’t out buying new cars, you can best believe they’re doing everything they can to take care of the ones they have. Cars inevitably need maintenance as they age and have more miles put on them, even during a recession. Plus, as long as the freight industry continues to remain strong, there will be a need for servicing big rigs and delivery trucks.</p>
<br /><p>Times have changed, and more and more families have two working parents, whether out of necessity or personal preference. Paid childcare services provide supervision, care, and sometimes education to infants and young children.</p>
<br /><p>Childcare services were valued at $54.3 billion in 2019 and will continue to grow. From 2020 to 2027, there is an expected compound annual growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
<br /><p>During a recession, parents may have to work longer hours or even more than one job. While historically expensive, childcare services are still one of the last costs parents abandon. Not to mention they usually make up a significant part of their budget. It’s not just about a safe place to leave your child while you’re at work. For many, it’s the first step of their growth and education.</p>
<br /><p>The real estate industry involves the sale of land, residential, commercial, and industrial properties. But, there are other businesses involving real estate that may also thrive during a recession, like property management or investment firms.</p>
<br /><p>Zillow Group expects that home value will continue to rise, going up 7.8 percent in the next 12 months.</p>
<br /><p>It might surprise you to see real estate on our list when you consider the Great Recession. However, historically speaking, a recession does not always mean the housing market will crash. As of right now, home prices continue to soar, but even if prices drop, it may be the perfect opportunity for investors.</p>
<br /><p>While prices fluctuate short term, the sector is usually more stable in the long run. Real estate even proved to be one of the most pandemic-proof businesses as the housing market boomed.</p>
<br /><p>Millions of businesses and firms seek outside help regarding accounting and other financial information services, as do individuals. With rules and regulations getting more complicated and confusing, consulting experts seems to be the go-to move. Services offered include tax preparation, bookkeeping, and invoice outsourcing.</p>
<br /><p>Worldwide, the financial services market grew from $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<br /><p>Even if the economy slows down, it never comes to a full halt. In fact, financial services drive the economy. So, many financial and accounting services continue to do well during hard times.</p>
<br /><p>Home improvement services encompass a wide range of offerings aimed at enhancing and maintaining residential properties. These services can include renovations, remodeling, repairs, and upgrades to various areas of a home, such as kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, roofing, and more. Whether homeowners want to increase their property’s value, create a more comfortable living space, or address necessary repairs, the home improvement industry caters to their diverse needs.</p>
<br /><p>The home improvement industry accounted for $538 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach more than $620 billion by 2025.</p>
<br /><p>Certain services this industry provides, such as HVAC repair, electric, and home repair, are necessary even during a recession. AC units don’t care about the economic situation, but many Americans live in areas where you simply cannot live without it. Damaged roofs, leaking pipes, and other issues will still need to be repaired immediately. Home improvement also turned out to be a covid-proof business. With people stuck at home, many decided to fix up their houses.</p>
<br /><p>Americans sure do love their pets. The animal care industry is massive and covers many different categories, including medical care, toys, daycare, and more. As people become more educated on animals’ needs and welfare, they are highly aware of where they put their money when it comes to their pets.</p>
<br /><p>The global pet care market is expected to grow to more than 325 billion by 2028, with dog products and services pulling in the highest revenues.</p>
<br /><p>If you believe everything you read on the internet, millennials have canceled having children and are having pets instead. Especially after the pandemic, the pet industry is breaking records, and proper pet care is not something most people are willing to forgo when money gets tight.</p>
<br /><p>Business consulting includes a broad range of professional services other companies need help with, such as strategy, market research, or public relations. Consultants or consulting firms are meant to help their clients by solving specific problems or issues, often saving them money.</p>
<br /><p>From freelancers to large firms, consulting businesses are generating up to $300 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<br /><p>Consulting businesses can stay afloat during recessions because of their ability to be flexible and adapt to market situations. If companies are struggling to make money and you can help them create growth or optimize during a recession, they will want to keep you around. Plus, staying profitable will be much easier with no inventory and little overhead.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS market has grown at insane speeds over the past ten years and isn’t likely to slow down. Software as a service is delivered via the internet rather than installing complicated software and hardware. As a cloud-based service, the ease, scalability, and security are high, and users typically pay a monthly or yearly fee.</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth is expected to continue, with the market estimated to be worth about $208 billion in 2023, with US companies leading the way.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS industry is another with little to no overhead, making them easier for businesses to maintain during a recession. In addition, many of these software are fully integrated into business processes, so companies can’t afford to ditch them during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>The healthcare industry includes a wide range of services, from hospitals and medical clinics to pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers. The healthcare sector is dedicated to promoting, maintaining, and restoring human health through medical and therapeutic interventions.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, the healthcare market is expected to reach nearly $59 billion in 2023 and show an annual growth rate of 10.4 percent in the years to come.</p>
<br /><p>Healthcare is a fundamental need that people cannot do without, regardless of the economic situation. During a recession, individuals may cut back on unnecessary spending, but they will continue to seek medical care when necessary. Moreover, the recent global pandemic has highlighted the significance of pandemic-proof businesses in the healthcare industry. The ability to provide essential medical services, telehealth consultations, and innovative solutions while adapting to rapidly changing circumstances has highlighted the industry’s resilience.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, in 2020, about 16.9 percent of the United States population was 65 or older. By 2030, that percentage is projected to reach 20.6 percent. This demographic shift emphasizes the demand for senior services for this growing population segment.</p>
<br /><p>Senior services may include a range of businesses that cater to the needs of the elderly population. As people age, they may require assistance with daily activities, healthcare, companionship, and other specialized services to maintain a high quality of life.</p>
<br /><p>The aging population’s continuous growth has led to an increased need for senior services, making this one of the most recession-proof industries. For many elderly individuals, these services are crucial for their well-being and safety, ensuring their relevance even during economic downturns. Additionally, the expansion of retirement communities and assisted living facilities opens up further opportunities for entrepreneurs in this field.</p>
<br /><p>Starting an entire business from scratch can be costly, take a while to get things moving, and have no guarantee of success after all your hard work and dedication. A recession-proof franchise can take a lot of the guesswork out of the equation and help you get your business up and running much faster.</p>
<br /><p>Franchising offers a proven business model with established brand recognition, training, and ongoing support from the franchisor. By investing in a recession-proof franchise, such as one with P3 Cost Analysts, you can leverage the expertise and experience of a well-established brand, increasing your chances of success even during challenging economic times. Additionally, as part of a larger network, you can benefit from collective buying power, marketing resources, and shared knowledge.</p>

<br /><p>The post Top Last Mile Delivery Companies and Startups in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>This article will explore the top last mile delivery companies and startups this year, shedding light on established industry leaders and emerging disruptors. Whether you’re looking for reliable global logistics giants or innovative local players, this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of last mile logistics.</p>
<br /><p>Last mile delivery is the final stage and arguably the most important part of the logistics process. This leg of the delivery process refers to when goods are transported from a distribution or fulfillment center to the customer’s doorstep. It is the crucial link between businesses and consumers. Last mile delivery plays a significant role in customer satisfaction and the overall success of e-commerce and retail operations.</p>
<br /><p>The process from customer purchase to last mile delivery looks something like this. First, a customer places an order, usually through an online retailer. The company then processes, packs, and prepares the item for shipment from its fulfillment center. At this point, the delivery vehicle will collect the product. Last mile delivery may be handled by the company themselves, such as with Amazon, or via a third party. Either way, the shipper is responsible for optimizing delivery routes for efficiency. Once the package has been delivered, the driver marks the order as complete.</p>
<br /><p>In recent years, the growth of e-commerce has led to an increased emphasis on last mile delivery services. Customers now expect faster, more convenient, and more flexible delivery options. E-commerce giants like Amazon have placed pressure on smaller companies to keep up with these advancements.</p>
<br /><p>While Amazon handles its own shipping needs, other businesses often rely on third-party last mile delivery companies to ship their products. These providers have responded to growing industry pressure by adopting innovative technologies – such as route optimization software, tracking systems, and delivery drones or robots – to streamline their last mile operations. In addition to the major players, we are now seeing startup companies looking to disrupt the industry, as well as software to help businesses optimize their shipping processes.</p>
<br /><p>Industry trends in last mile logistics mirror those of many other industries. As technology advances, people prioritize sustainability, and the demands of consumers evolve, each sector must adapt.</p>
<br /><p>Each year, the technological advancements in the industry continue to surprise us. One trend that is taking the industry by storm is robotics and automation. Self-driving delivery vehicles, drones, and other autonomous vehicles can not only lower costs and improve delivery times but also improve traffic issues. Additional technological advancements include AI route optimization, real-time communication tools, and GPS tracking systems.</p>
<br /><p>Sustainability has become a key focus in the last mile delivery sector. With increasing environmental concerns and pressure from the masses, companies are adopting more sustainable practices to reduce carbon emissions. This includes the use of electric vehicles and alternative fuel sources, as well as optimizing delivery routes to minimize fuel consumption. Some companies are also exploring more localized fulfillment operations, utilizing eco-friendly packaging materials, and implementing recycling programs to reduce waste.</p>
<br /><p>Enhancing the customer experience is a top priority for last mile delivery providers. Real-time tracking systems allow customers to monitor the progress of their deliveries and receive accurate estimated arrival times. Delivery notifications through SMS or mobile apps enable customers to plan their schedules accordingly. Moreover, personalized delivery options, such as choosing delivery time windows or designated safe drop-off locations, contribute to a more convenient and satisfying customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>The demand for faster deliveries, including same-day and on-demand services, has grown significantly. Last mile delivery providers are adapting to this trend by offering expedited delivery options. Some companies have developed networks of local couriers or crowd-sourced drivers to fulfill immediate delivery requests. Additionally, partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores or lockers enable customers to pick up or return orders at convenient locations.</p>
<br /><p>These well-established industry leaders have built a strong reputation and extensive networks in the last mile delivery space. With their focus on optimization, reliability, and innovative solutions, they have set the benchmark for efficient and effective delivery services.</p>

<br /><p>The post 8 Best Recession-Proof Franchises in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>One way entrepreneurs can maintain financial stability and even grow their wealth amidst a recession is by starting a recession-proof franchise. The support and community of a franchise allow its franchisees to not only survive but also thrive and adapt more easily than other types of businesses during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we will explore which industries succeed during a recession and provide some examples of recession-proof franchises you can start this year.</p>
<br /><p>A recession occurs when there is a major drop in economic activity across sectors lasting for a significant period of time. Therefore, a recession-proof business is one that can continue to succeed amidst these uncertain economic conditions.</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses operate in industries that provide essential products and services that people and businesses will need regardless of the economic climate. While the overall economy may be in a decline, recession-proof businesses will survive and or thrive during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>Industries that thrive during a recession are those that deliver products or services that people will pay for even when money is tight. In the list below, we explore some of the main industries that continue to thrive during a recession, followed by some of the best franchises available in each.</p>
<br /><p>When businesses are struggling during a recession, they turn to business consultants to help them reduce and optimize their spending. Businesses of all sizes can benefit from the advice of a third-party consultant. Depending on the type of consulting you want to do, you could help businesses with cost reduction, performance management, operational logistics, and much more.</p>
<br /><p>Whether we’re in a recession or not, things are bound to break. And when money is already tight due to a recession, people are more likely to repair their things versus buying new ones. That’s why various types of repair service businesses are able to succeed during a recession. Businesses that specialize in auto repair, plumbing, roofing, HVAC, and other trades are likely to maintain a steady stream of work during economic downturns.</p>
<br /><p>The senior population is on the rise and will continue to rise for years to come. With many of these seniors preferring to stay at their current residence versus moving to an assisted living facility as they age, the demand for in-home senior care will continue to grow regardless of economic conditions.</p>
<br /><p>Even when the economy is in a downturn, commercial spaces still need to be cleaned. Though many companies now allow a large portion of their employees to work from home, their offices still need to be cleaned for the employees that do work in the office. Our current pandemic has also put an emphasis on sanitation and cleanliness, which makes commercial cleaning services a lucrative industry to be in during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>One thing for certain is that people will always need to eat and drink regardless of economic conditions. Though many people will cut back on their food and beverage budgets, they will still spend what they can on these items. Additionally, when times are tough, people may look at snacks or alcoholic beverages as “affordable luxuries” during a time when they aren’t spending their money on other non-essential items. Businesses such as grocery stores, convenience stores, and liquor stores all tend to fare well during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>Businesses rely on technology and a variety of different devices for their daily operations. Even when the economy is on the decline, businesses and individuals need their technology infrastructure and devices serviced and repaired on an ongoing basis. For these reasons, the IT services industry is well-positioned to handle any type of economic climate.</p>
<br /><p>Even in the midst of economic downturns, one industry that remains remarkably resilient is pet services. This is because pets are more than just animals to their owners – they are cherished family members. From pet grooming and boarding to training and veterinary care, the demand for pet services remains steady throughout economic fluctuations. People continue to invest in their pets’ health, happiness, and socialization needs, as they consider it an essential part of their overall quality of life.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to the education industry, focusing on children’s learning and development can offer many recession-proof franchise ideas. The value placed on children’s education remains unwavering even during economic downturns, as parents prioritize investing in their children’s future. Franchises that specialize in educational services for kids, such as tutoring centers, enrichment programs, and early childhood education, are well-positioned to thrive.</p>
<br /><p>By becoming a franchisee with P3 Cost Analysts, you’ll be able to help businesses reduce spending while building a business in a growing industry. P3 provides comprehensive training and support in order to position franchisees for success with all of their cost reduction consulting responsibilities.</p>

<br /><p>Pet Supplies Plus is a standout recession-resistent franchise in the pet industry.

<br /><p>The post 8 Best Recession-Proof Franchises in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>The post How to Cancel Republic Services (Read This First) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Waste management companies are notorious for these unfair contracts, and Republic Services is no exception. There are many people out there trying to cancel Republic Services, only to be met with a complicated process or no response from their representatives. If this is you, keep reading to get a better understanding of the Republic Services cancellation process and figure out how to get the help you need.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services is a prominent waste management company that provides a comprehensive range of waste collection and disposal services. Claiming a commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, Republic Services focuses on managing waste responsibly while offering efficient and reliable solutions. The company serves millions of residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers across the United States.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services offers various waste management services tailored to meet diverse needs. Their residential services encompass curbside waste collection, recycling programs, and yard waste removal. For businesses, Republic Services provides customized waste and recycling solutions, including commercial dumpster rentals, compactor services, and comprehensive waste management plans.</p>
<br /><p>Many people find themselves or their business in an undesirable contract with Republic Services. Often, these contracts have favorable terms for Republic Services, while the other party gets the short end of the stick.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re considering entering into an agreement with Republic Services, you should consider the following things:</p>
<br /><p>Additional fees popping up on your invoice are not unique to Republic Services. The entire waste management industry is known for having billing errors and overcharges on their invoices. Republic Services outlines the fees that may appear on their invoices in the contract for invoice-to-invoice agreements. These include:</p>
<br /><p>Not only should you expect your contract to include clauses for many different types of fees, but Republic Services is also known to include rate increases for services that may or may not be lawful. The waste management company has been on the receiving end of various lawsuits due to unlawful rate increases and fuel recovery fees, according to the website Republic Services Exposed. Knowing that Republic has already had issues with unlawful rate increases may cause business owners to seek Republic Services’ contract termination methods.</p>
<br /><p>The same website also reports that Republic Services has been forced to refund millions of dollars to their customers due to unauthorized fees and overcharges. Customers are responsible for finding these errors and invoices and submitting a claim for a refund. Most business owners don’t have time to dedicate to this process and therefore end up overspending on trash collection. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can help businesses immensely by handling invoice audits for them or helping them cancel Republic Services.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to employing questionable contract tactics, Republic Services lacks transparency and standard pricing. Some sales representatives prioritize commissions by encouraging customers to pay more for services, and business owners can’t trust that their representatives have their best interests at heart.</p>
<br /><p>If you go to the customer support portion of their website, the Republic Services Cancellation Policy looks pretty straightforward. Just give them a call and speak to your representative. In reality, many customers have a very hard time getting a hold of anyone to speak to at all.</p>
<br /><p>To guarantee the best success rate, we recommend working with a professional waste management auditor like P3 Cost Analysts, as there are numerous roadblocks not covered here Republic could put in your way. If you would like to go it alone, the following steps can serve as a guide for you.</p>
<br /><p>You should have read the fine print of your contract, like the terms and conditions, before signing. But if it’s been a while, or you didn’t pay close enough attention, you should go back to your contract before reaching out to your representative. Find out the specific cancellation requirements as outlined in your contract so you enter the conversation with all the necessary information and don’t experience any surprises.</p>
<br /><p>The next step is to call Republic Services. According to their website, you can find a phone number for your representative on the front of your invoice. Another option is to call their customer support line. Before calling, gather all the necessary account information to make the process smoother. Some customers may also have the option to cancel through the customer portal.</p>
<br /><p>It’s important to note that the Republic Services Cancellation Policy states that advance notice is required to cancel their services. Oftentimes it will not go into effect until 30 days after they receive cancellation.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re able to get a hold of your Republic Services representative or a customer support agent, clearly state that your intention is to cancel their services. Waste management companies often make it difficult for their customers to get out of the contract, so they may try to convince you to stay with them. It would be a good idea to document the time, date, and name of the representative you’re speaking with in case you run into problems down the line. It’s highly likely they will reference the contract or refer to the fact you are in an auto-renewal period at this time.</p>
<br /><p>If the representative you speak with gives you any further instructions on how to finish the Republic Services contract termination process, make sure you complete each step. This may include instructions on what to do with any equipment of theirs or official forms you need to fill out.</p>
<br /><p>There have been reports of people requesting cancellation but continuing to be charged by Republic Services. Request a confirmation of the cancellation in writing just in case they continue to charge you after your requested cancellation date. Be sure to check for future invoices and keep an eye out for any refunds you’re expecting.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re struggling with these steps on your own, save yourself the frustration. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts have decades of experience going up against giant waste-hauling companies like Republic Services. We can help you figure out how to cancel Republic Services, as well as help you find a better waste-hauling company and monitor future invoices for errors and overcharges from your next provider.</p>
<br /><p>With so many customers having issues with Republic Services and other heavy hitters such as Waste Management, some have started to look for smaller, more local waste-hauling companies that may provide a better customer experience. These organizations are also likely to be more flexible during contract negotiations.</p>
<br /><p>In many cases, Republic may be your best option. But in some cases you have choices. If you want Republic Services to stop service to your home or business, you’ll need to find another waste hauler to replace them.</p>
<br /><p>The first step is to cancel Republic Services; then you can begin shopping around for new providers. However, it’s important not to get locked into another predatory contract. P3 Cost Analysts can step in here to help you negotiate an agreement that serves you.</p>
<br /><p>There is no shortage of disappointed customers working with Republic Services, just like most of the other major waste-hauling providers. Unfortunately, these contracts are often written in favor of the supplier, leaving businesses and residences stuck with no way out.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services makes it appear that the Republic Services Stop Service Process is straightforward and simple. Just follow the steps – look at your contract, contact your representative, and request a cancellation. Unfortunately, many people don’t have such a simple experience.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re looking for help at any stage of the waste management contract process, contact P3 Cost Analysts’ waste auditors. We will help you with the Republic Services cancellation process, as well as auditing your invoices, ensuring the cost-effectiveness of your contracts, and catching overcharges.</p>

<br /><p>The post Franchise Registration States: A Guide for Franchisees appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>To make things more clear, let’s explore the different types of franchise laws and highlight franchise registration states, franchise filing states, and franchise relationship states. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for both franchisors and prospective franchisees.</p>
<br /><p>As with all things business-related, federal and state governments have implemented a set of laws to control how franchises are registered, sold, and contracted. These legal requirements are in place to regulate the relationship between franchisors (the companies granting franchises) and franchisees (the individuals or entities purchasing and operating a franchise).</p>
<br /><p>The goal of these regulations is to provide a framework that promotes fairness, transparency, and protection for both parties. By establishing legal frameworks and guidelines, franchise laws provide a level of confidence and protection to prospective franchisees, encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting the growth of franchise businesses.</p>
<br /><p>In the United States, federal franchise laws primarily revolve around the regulation of franchise sales and disclosures. The key federal franchise law is the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Franchise Rule, which sets forth requirements for franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with certain information before they enter into a franchise agreement.</p>
<br /><p>The Franchise Rule mandates that franchisors provide a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to prospective franchisees at least 14 days before signing any agreement or making any payment. The FDD contains essential information about the franchisor, the franchise system, the franchise fee, ongoing costs, territory, trademarks, litigation history, and other relevant details.</p>
<br /><p>While federal franchise laws primarily focus on disclosure requirements and preventing fraudulent or deceptive practices, other federal laws — such as employment, intellectual property, and antitrust laws — may also apply to franchising.</p>
<br /><p>While federal franchise laws establish baseline requirements, state franchise laws often add additional provisions and requirements that franchisors and franchisees must adhere to. Franchisors must comply with the specific registration requirements in each state where they wish to offer franchises. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences, penalties, or even the inability to sell franchises in that state.</p>
<br /><p>Each state has its own set of franchise registration laws, and the requirements can vary. Some states have rigorous registration processes, while others have more lenient procedures. Below, we take a look at the difference between franchise registration states, franchise filing states, and franchise relationship states.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise registration states are U.S. states that require franchisors to register their franchise offering before selling franchises. These states have specific laws in place to protect prospective franchisees and ensure transparency. Franchisors must submit a comprehensive FDD that contains important information about the franchise opportunity. The FDD must be reviewed and approved by a state examiner who ensures that all state requirements have been filled.</p>
<br /><p>For potential franchisees, registration states offer several benefits and implications. First, franchisees are guaranteed access to comprehensive information about potential franchise opportunities. This enables potential franchisees to make informed decisions and thoroughly evaluate various franchises.</p>
<br /><p>The standardized and transparent disclosure process also ensures that franchisees have recourse and legal remedies if the franchisor fails to provide the required disclosures or engages in fraudulent or misleading practices.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise filing states also require that franchises file specific documents and pay a fee. However, the difference is that there is no approval process. These requirements, while not as strict as franchise registration states, aim to provide transparency and protect the interests of prospective franchisees by ensuring that franchisors meet certain standards and obligations before operating within the state.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise filing states offer some of the same benefits as registration states. However, since the filing requirements aren’t approved by the state, the level of protection isn’t the same. Still, franchise filing states offer increased transparency, regulatory oversight, state-specific protections, and enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<br /><p>If a state does not have franchise registration or franchise filing requirements, it is generally referred to as a non-registration state or a non-filing state. In these states, franchisors are not required to submit specific documents or disclosures to state authorities before offering or selling franchises. However, even in non-registration states, franchisors are still obligated to comply with federal franchise laws and stay in accordance with the Federal Franchise Rule.</p>
<br /><p>Despite the fact that these states still must follow federal regulations, there is limited state oversight in the franchising process. For franchisees, this enhances the importance of the due diligence process. Franchisees need to carefully review the FDD, seek legal advice, and conduct independent research to assess the viability and risks of the franchise opportunity. In addition, there may be fewer legal remedies in case of disputes with the franchisor or misrepresentation and unfair practices.</p>

<br /><p>Understanding franchise laws is crucial for both franchisors and prospective franchisees. Franchise registration states prioritize transparency and protection for franchisees by requiring franchisors to register their offerings and submit comprehensive disclosures. This ensures that potential franchisees have access to crucial information and legal remedies in case of fraudulent practices.</p>
<br /><p>While franchise filing states also aim to provide transparency and protection, in non-registration states, franchisees must rely on federal regulations and exercise due diligence to assess the likelihood of success and potential risks of the franchise opportunity. Regardless of which state you’re in, the P3 Cost Analysts franchise opportunity offers a low buy-in investment, comprehensive training, ongoing support, and all necessary software to help franchisees succeed in the cost reduction industry.</p>

<br /><p>The post What Is UPS SurePost? (+ How to Save On UPS Shipping) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>As businesses strive to meet the growing expectations of their customers, offering free shipping has emerged as a powerful strategy for boosting sales and enhancing customer satisfaction. However, for businesses to provide this enticing perk, they must navigate the complex realm of shipping logistics, where affordable shipping rates are key. UPS’s answer to this market need is its SurePost service.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a closer look at the specifics of UPS SurePost, including how it works, how long it takes, the specific benefits, and other ways to save money on shipping costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a service offered by the United Parcel Service (UPS) that combines the efficiency of UPS’s ground network with the final delivery handled by the United States Postal Service (USPS). It is designed to provide an economical and convenient shipping option for lightweight, non-urgent packages. It is commonly used for e-commerce shipments, allowing businesses that ship at least ten packages daily to offer affordable shipping options to their customers.</p>
<br /><p>The ideal SurePost package should be lightweight and compact enough to fit easily within a mail truck, weighing less than ten pounds and measuring under one cubic foot. Furthermore, the shipments should be destined for residential addresses, involve business-to-consumer transactions, possess a value below $100, and require only limited liability coverage. By meeting these requirements, shippers can leverage UPS SurePost to efficiently and affordably deliver their packages to customers.</p>
<br /><p>As mentioned above, UPS SurePost operates through a strategic collaboration between UPS and the USPS. The process begins when businesses enter into a contractual agreement for UPS SurePost services, which often involves parcel contract negotiation. Initially, UPS handles the transportation of the packages from the sender’s location to a designated UPS facility. At this point, UPS consolidates and sorts the packages before transferring them to the USPS for the final mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Once the packages are in the hands of the USPS, they are integrated into the existing USPS infrastructure for local delivery. USPS carriers transport the packages directly to their intended destinations, including residential addresses. Throughout the entire process, UPS provides robust tracking capabilities, allowing both businesses and customers to monitor the progress of their shipments and ensure transparency and peace of mind.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost packages are delivered by the United States Postal Service (USPS) as the last-mile carrier. The USPS is responsible for the final leg of the delivery process, bringing the packages directly to customers’ doorsteps. This delivery method is particularly well-suited for residential addresses and offers convenience for recipients who may not be available during regular business hours.</p>
<br /><p>While the average UPS SurePost delivery time may vary based on factors such as distance, location, and local USPS operations, they typically align with the USPS’s regular delivery schedule. It’s important to note that delivery to certain areas, such as rural or remote regions, may have specific limitations or longer transit times due to USPS service coverage.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, UPS SurePost deliveries generally follow the USPS delivery calendar, which typically excludes Sunday deliveries. However, UPS SurePost packages can still be in transit during weekends as they move through the UPS and USPS networks. It’s advisable to check with UPS or USPS for any specific delivery exceptions or holiday schedules that may impact SurePost deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost and UPS Ground are two residential ground services offered by UPS that allow businesses to decide between focusing on lowering shipping costs or enhancing customer experience. Both services have their advantages, with UPS Ground offering comprehensive coverage and flexibility, while UPS SurePost is more economical and utilizes the USPS network for efficient last-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>UPS Ground is delivered exclusively by UPS drivers, providing day-definite delivery typically within one to five business days. It offers multiple delivery attempts, a service guarantee, proof of delivery, and delivery of all package types. In addition, UPS Ground offers more value-added service options that aren’t available with SurePost, such as confirmation signatures, receiver management, and collect-on-delivery.</p>
<br /><p>On the other hand, UPS SurePost is best suited for small and lightweight packages and leverages the single-carrier network of UPS. With SurePost, businesses can deliver to PO boxes and all US territories.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to shipping with UPS SurePost, there are several advantages that businesses can capitalize on. From robust tracking capabilities to expedited delivery times, UPS SurePost offers benefits that can enhance the shipping experience for both businesses and their customers.</p>
<br /><p>UPS provides tracking capabilities for packages shipped with SurePost from start to finish. Businesses can monitor the progress of their shipments, ensuring transparency and peace of mind throughout the delivery process. Customers can also track their orders, offering them visibility and reassurance.</p>
<br /><p>UPS doesn’t stage packages for consolidation before sending them out for final-mile delivery with USPS. This means packages move through the network quickly, speeding up delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>One of the notable benefits of shipping with UPS SurePost is its commitment to environmental sustainability through carbon neutrality. UPS has taken significant steps to minimize its environmental impact and offers carbon-neutral shipping options for SurePost customers for $0.05 per package.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is offered to businesses using a direct-to-consumer business model as well. This means that online retailers can also reap the benefits of this affordable shipping option, with UPS collecting parcels directly from their warehouse.</p>
<br /><p>While UPS SurePost offers notable benefits, it’s important to consider potential limitations or drawbacks associated with this shipping service. By understanding these considerations, businesses can make informed decisions and determine if UPS SurePost aligns with their specific shipping requirements and objectives.</p>
<br /><p>UPS can only offer SurePost deliveries to addresses that USPS delivers to. While their network does cover most addresses in the country, there are some rural areas that are not included. In addition, offshore and military destinations may be subject to longer delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>For packages that cannot be delivered, if the shipper wants the package returned, they will incur postage fees from the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>When shipping with UPS SurePost, businesses benefit from limited liability coverage of up to $100. This coverage provides a degree of financial protection in the event of loss, damage, or theft during transit. However, this liability is only up until the point of transfer to the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>While choosing the right parcel delivery carrier and service offering is a huge step toward lowering shipping costs, there are other ways to save even more. If you’re looking to reduce shipping expenses and improve your bottom line, utilizing third-party companies like P3 Cost Analysts can make a significant difference. With our expertise in shipping contracts and invoicing audits, we can help save your business around 20 percent of your current delivery costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a contractual service, and carrier contracts can be complex and challenging to navigate, with different pricing tiers and fine print that can impact your costs. P3’s team of experts, comprised of former pricing analysts from major carriers, understands these intricacies and can provide insights to help you negotiate better deals.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to securing better rates, third-party companies like P3 can also conduct thorough parcel invoice audits to ensure you’re not missing out on refunds and credits. Billions of dollars in shipping refunds go unclaimed each year, and our auditing process can help you identify and recover any owed refunds, providing a valuable boost to your bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>What is the difference between UPS SurePost and UPS?</p>
<br /><p>UPS is a shipping carrier that offers many different shipping services for companies and individuals alike. SurePost is one of their offerings that utilizes the USPS for the final mile delivery to residential addresses, resulting in cost savings for businesses.</p>
<br /><p>Who is UPS SurePost delivered by?</p>
<br /><p>The idea behind SurePost is that UPS handles the initial transportation of the packages, and then they are handed over to the USPS for local delivery. Initially, most UPS SurePost parcels were handled by the USPS for the final leg of the delivery. However, UPS now performs around 40 percent of packages’ final-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>How does UPS SurePost tracking work?</p>
<br /><p>Customers can track a SurePost package throughout the entire shipping process. UPS’s robust tracking capabilities follow parcels all the way through the final mile using the same tracking number.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver on Sunday?</p>
<br /><p>SurePost’s guaranteed delivery days are from Monday through Saturday. However, in some locations where USPS offers Sunday deliveries and UPS has Saturday operations, packages may be delivered on Sunday as well.</p>
<br /><p>Is UPS SurePost safe?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost is generally considered safe for shipping packages. However, it’s important for businesses to ensure proper packaging to protect the contents during transportation. UPS provides guidelines and recommendations for packaging to ensure safe delivery. Still, with limited liability, high-value packages are best shipped through UPS Ground.</p>
<br /><p>How reliable is UPS SurePost?</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is known to be a reliable shipping service, offering consistent delivery times and a track record of successful package transportation. However, delivery times may vary depending on factors such as origin and destination locations, weather conditions, and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver to PO boxes?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost does deliver to PO boxes. The USPS is responsible for the final delivery of packages, and they have the capability to deliver to PO boxes as part of their standard mail services.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is an excellent low-cost shipping option for businesses. It combines UPS’s ground network with USPS for final delivery, making it an affordable solution for lightweight packages. SurePost offers advantages like tracking, quick package movement, and carbon-neutral shipping. However, it’s important to consider delivery limitations and limited liability coverage.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re ready to take control of your shipping costs and explore ways to save, consider partnering with a trusted third-party company like P3 Cost Analysts. We can help you negotiate the best conditions for your shipping contracts and audit ongoing invoices to ensure you’re not overpaying.</p>

<br /><p>The post FedEx SmartPost: How It Worked and What Replaced It appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>One particular challenge in the shipping process is the last-mile delivery, which refers to the final leg of a package’s journey from a local distribution center to the customer’s address. Interestingly, this seemingly short distance can often be the most costly and complex part of package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx is one shipping company that has recently changed how they handle land-mile package deliveries. In 2021, the company began the rebranding from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy to keep up with the explosive growth of e-commerce and optimize its last-mile delivery process. Today, we’ll look at the former FedEx SmartPost, the shift to FedEx Ground Economy, and what that means for businesses like yours.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost was a hybrid shipping service that combined the resources of FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for package delivery. It was designed to provide a cost-effective solution for shipping lightweight packages to residential addresses by combining the speed and reliability of FedEx’s express network with the extensive reach of the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>When still operating, FedEx SmartPost utilized FedEx’s extensive express network for long-distance transportation and then handed off the packages to USPS for last-mile delivery. This collaboration allowed FedEx SmartPost to reach every U.S. residential address, including PO boxes and military residences, while offering competitive shipping rates for businesses. Despite the last mile being operated by USPS, shippers still had tracking capabilities and service available Monday to Saturday.</p>
<br /><p>The way FedEx SmartPost functioned allowed the shipping company to offer competitive shipping prices. However, the program was most useful for small, lightweight packages that weren’t time sensitive. Some shippers complained that the service was too slow or unreliable.</p>
<br /><p>The transition from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy was driven by several factors and the need to adapt to a changing market. Here are some of the likely reasons behind this decision:</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to a significant increase in package volume being shipped to residential addresses. This surge in online shopping has placed greater demands on shipping services to handle higher volumes efficiently. FedEx recognized the need to optimize its operations to meet the growing demand and provide an improved customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost’s hybrid model of utilizing both FedEx’s express network and the USPS for final delivery presented some operational complexities. The transition to FedEx Ground Economy aimed to streamline operations by consolidating operations within FedEx’s own network and utilizing contracted drivers. This allows FedEx to have more control over the entire shipping process, resulting in improved efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>By focusing on ground transportation for the entire delivery process, FedEx can optimize routes, utilize its own delivery fleet more effectively, and potentially reduce costs associated with third-party partnerships.</p>
<br /><p>Overall, the transition from FedEx SmartPost to Ground Economy was driven by the need to adapt to the changing landscape of e-commerce, optimize operational efficiency, reduce costs, and provide an improved shipping experience for customers. By streamlining operations and focusing on ground transportation, FedEx aimed to meet the evolving demands of the market while ensuring efficient and reliable package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>While FedEx SmartPost relied on FedEx’s express network and USPS for last-mile delivery, FedEx Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network, providing more control over the entire delivery process. FedEx Ground drivers, or sometimes contracted third-party drivers, complete the last-mile delivery, bringing packages directly to recipients’ addresses.</p>
<br /><p>These changes are an effort by FedEx to ensure greater reliability and faster transit times compared to SmartPost. One major change from SmartPost to Ground Economy is the addition of Sunday deliveries. Ground Economy is a strong contender for businesses looking for outbound deliveries that are low-weight and non-urgent. Still, the following options are not available for Ground Economy:</p>
<br /><p>The shift from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy began in 2019 as the company began delivering most SmartPost packages through their networks. The official rebrand happened in 2021 when they publicly introduced FedEx Ground Economy. The slow transition and similar product offerings meant that the two programs have many similarities; however, there are some key differences as well.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost utilized a hybrid model, combining FedEx’s express network for long-distance transportation and the USPS for last-mile delivery. Packages were handed off from FedEx to the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network. It relies on ground transportation methods, such as trucks, for the entire delivery process, without involving the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost shipping time was generally longer when compared to other FedEx services due to the involvement of the USPS for the last mile. Estimated FedEx SmartPost shipping time ranged from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination, and there were no Sunday deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>Estimated delivery times for Ground Economy are similar to that of SmartPost. Deliveries range from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination. However, FedEx now delivers Monday through Sunday, allowing them to shorten the average delivery time.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost Returns followed a similar process to outbound delivery. To offer returns for their customers, businesses would include a prepaid shipping label along with the shipment. Then, the customer could leave the box in their mailbox, give it to their USPS carrier, or drop it off at a FedEx office.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy returns functions nearly the same as FedEx SmartPost Returns. However, customers now have even more options, with the ability to print a shipping label from a QR code or create one online.</p>
<br /><p>Tracking was available for packages delivered through SmartPost, even once the package was handed off to USPS. The 20-digital FedEx tracking number was converted to a USPS tracking number once the handoff was processed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that Ground Economy handles delivery for the entire process, only the FedEx tracking number is needed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that we understand the similarities and differences between FedEx Ground Economy and FedEx SmartPost, we can compare them with another popular delivery option, FedEx Home Delivery. First off, Home Delivery accepts packages up to 150 pounds, while Ground Economy has a maximum of 70 pounds. In addition, Home Delivery is a bit faster, with deliveries made between one and five business days.</p>
<br /><p>However, perhaps one of the largest differences between the two programs is the contractual agreement. Ground Economy is a contract service, meaning businesses must sign an agreement with FedEx outlining the terms and conditions of the contract. Meanwhile, Home Delivery is not a contract service.</p>
<br /><p>The rebranding of FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy brings significant implications for shippers. Parcel management, with its inherent complexities and risks, requires careful attention to avoid unnecessary costs. By eliminating the handoff to USPS and taking responsibility for final mile delivery in-house, FedEx aims to streamline the process and enhance efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>However, this shift still necessitates FedEx contract negotiation and thorough FedEx invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and maximize return on investment. Companies must be vigilant in monitoring any invoice errors or unjust surcharges on their bills each month.</p>
<br /><p>The importance of analytics and shipment auditing cannot be overstated in today’s shipping industry. To address these challenges and optimize small parcel shipping costs, partnering with a cost reduction firm is your best choice. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can provide invaluable expertise and solutions. By leveraging comprehensive analytics and auditing capabilities, we help shippers make informed decisions, uncover savings opportunities, and enhance their overall shipping strategies.</p>
<br /><p>The exponential growth of e-commerce and the need for operational efficiency and cost optimization have prompted FedEx to streamline its operations and bring the entire delivery process in-house. By eliminating the transfer to USPS and relying solely on its own network, FedEx aims to enhance reliability, shorten transit times, and provide a better shipping experience for customers.</p>
<br /><p>While the transition from SmartPost to Ground Economy offers several benefits, one thing remains constant regardless of which parcel delivery service business owners choose. Shippers must carefully review their contracts with FedEx, negotiate favorable terms, and conduct thorough invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and avoid unnecessary costs.</p>
<br /><p>Partnering with a cost reduction firm like P3 Cost Analysts can provide valuable expertise and solutions in navigating the complexities of small parcel shipping. We will help you get control over your shipping expenses and make sure the delivery companies are working for you.</p>

<br /><p>The post 12 Best Franchises for Women to Own in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>The post How Much Do Franchise Owners Really Make a Year? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>To shed light on this topic, we’re diving into data from Franchise Business Review, Glassdoor, Zippia, and ZipRecruiter to assess how much franchisees make on average and the potential yearly earnings one can expect.</p>
<br /><p>By analyzing average incomes across various industries and markets, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how much a franchise owner makes a year, guiding those interested in this path.</p>
<br /><p>The earning potential of franchise owners can vary widely, shaped by factors like industry, location, and individual business strategy, with reported salaries for franchise owners in the United States ranging from as low as $39,000 to as high as $204,800 annually. This range highlights the significant variability in income potential within the franchising world.</p>
<br /><p>Keep in mind these are just reported ranges of salaries. A franchise owner is a business owner, so they make money two different ways. One is by paying themselves a fair market salary for their services working for the company they own, and the second way they make money is if their business(a franchise in this case) makes a profit. If the franchise makes a profit, then the franchise owner makes money there as well.</p>
<br /><p>To better understand these differences, we’ve gathered data from various sources, providing a comprehensive overview of what franchise owners really earn across different contexts and scenarios.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review’s recent survey of nearly 30,000 franchisees offers valuable insights into the question, “How much do franchisees make?” The average annual income for franchise owners is reported at $107,119.</p>
<br /><p>Notably, franchise owners who have moved beyond the startup period, typically the first two years in business, see their average incomes increase to $118,792. This figure is significantly higher than the average salary of independent small business owners, which is $64,432 according to PayScale, showcasing a distinct advantage in the franchise model.</p>
<br /><p>The report also illustrates the impact of owning multiple franchise units. Franchisees operating a single unit report an average income of $90,200, while those with two to four units see their average annual incomes rise to $132,400. For franchise owners who expand their portfolio to five or more units, the average franchise owner salary escalates to an impressive $204,800.</p>
<br /><p>Glassdoor data sheds light on the earnings of franchise owners in the United States based on self-reported salary data. Their estimated total annual pay for a franchise owner is approximately $98,162. This information is based on Glassdoor’s proprietary Total Pay Estimate model, which draws from salaries reported by users plus extra pay, which can include bonuses, commissions, tips, and profit sharing. This extra pay can vary significantly depending on the specific pay models and profit-sharing structures of different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>The ‘Most Likely Range’ of total pay, falling within the 25th to 75th percentile of all reported data, spans from $74,000 to $137,000 annually. This detailed breakdown offers a realistic view of the average franchise owner salary, reflecting the varied compensation models across different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>According to Zippia, the average salary for a franchise owner in the United States is notably lower than other sources, at $49,588, with a typical range between $39,000 and $62,000 annually. Zippia further breaks down these figures by state, providing a regional perspective on franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>The lower figures reported by Zippia might be attributed to their data collection methodology, which includes a mix of employee self-reports, public internet data, and proprietary information from other companies. This blend of sources, while offering diverse insights, also introduces a potential for variance in accuracy, especially considering the self-reported nature of some data.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s state-by-state analysis of franchise owner salaries reveals that the national average salary is around $109,437, aligning more closely with other sources like Franchise Business Review. They provide a detailed regional breakdown, highlighting Minnesota as the top state with an average annual salary of $119,885 for franchise owners.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s methodology involves estimating compensation ranges for job listings where the employer does not state a pay range. This approach factors in the job title, location, and hiring company to generate their estimates.</p>
<br /><p>While these figures are based on a robust algorithm, it’s important for potential franchise owners to consider that these are estimates and may not completely align with the actual compensation range, which can fluctuate based on numerous factors.</p>
<br /><p>The Franchise Business Review report offers insight into the average salaries within various sectors, showcasing which industries may be the most profitable. Here’s a look at some key industries and their average franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>This sector includes companies that provide services to other businesses, such as consulting, marketing, and cost reduction services. These franchises often offer unique advantages, particularly in scalability and market demand. For instance, P3 Cost Analysts, a leader in cost reduction, combines strong market demand with a proven business model, making it an attractive option for those who want to work from home and scale without having to open multiple locations.</p>
<br /><p>Including a range of services like beauty, fitness, and cleaning, this industry caters directly to individual consumers. The high average salary reflects the consistent and growing consumer demand for personal services, driven by increasing disposable income and a focus on health and wellness.</p>
<br /><p>The senior care industry, significantly impacted by demographic trends such as an aging population, has seen a growing demand for elder care services. This sector includes a range of services like in-home care, nursing homes, senior living relocation services, and specialized healthcare. The high average salary in this industry reflects not only the essential nature of these services but also the expanding market as our population ages.</p>
<br /><p>The pet services industry, covering everything from grooming to pet daycare, capitalizes on the strong emotional bond people have with their pets. With increasing pet ownership and willingness to spend on pets, this industry has seen substantial growth, reflected in its attractive average salary.</p>
<br /><p>As you can see from the numbers above, the world of franchising offers a vast range of income potential. Due to this range, pinpointing an exact franchise owner salary can be challenging. However, there are several key factors that may determine how much franchise owners can earn.</p>
<br /><p>The geographic location of your franchise can significantly influence your earnings. Franchises situated in high-traffic areas or regions with a strong demand for your product or service tend to generate higher revenues and profits.</p>
<br /><p>The choice of industry can be a major driver of profitability. Some industries inherently yield higher profit margins than others, such as those listed above. For example, healthcare or specialized retail franchises may be harder to break into but often offer greater earning potential compared to highly competitive industries.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees with prior industry-specific experience may find it easier to adapt and operate efficiently. Experience can lead to better decision-making, streamlined operations, and a quicker return on investment, all contributing to higher earnings.</p>
<br /><p>The level of support and training provided by the franchisor can directly impact profitability. Franchise systems that offer comprehensive training programs, ongoing assistance, and marketing support enable franchisees to navigate challenges effectively and drive revenue growth.</p>
<br /><p>The royalty structure established by the franchisor is a critical factor in determining earnings. Higher royalty rates may reduce a franchisee’s profitability, while those with reasonable royalty fees can retain a larger share of their earnings, contributing to a healthier owner income.</p>
<br /><p>The number of franchise locations you operate can significantly influence your earnings. Owning multiple franchise units within the same or different franchise brands can offer several advantages in terms of profitability.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding these factors is essential for making informed decisions and when considering the average franchise owner salary.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review stands out as potentially the most reliable source, having directly surveyed nearly 30,000 franchisees. However, it’s important to acknowledge that their data, like the others, is self-reported. This aspect underscores the need for a cautious approach in interpreting these figures, as self-reported data can be subject to biases and individual variances.</p>
<br /><p>The ranges of franchise owner salaries reported by these sources are quite broad, highlighting the variability in earnings across the franchise industry. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the franchise’s location, the specific industry, and the operational efficiency of each franchise. Such variability suggests that prospective franchise owners should consider a wide array of factors when evaluating potential earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Despite differences in the numbers between sources like Zippia and ZipRecruiter, there is a consistent trend where franchise owners in the Northeast, West Coast, and Midwest regions generally report higher salaries. This geographical trend is a crucial consideration for potential franchisees, as it indicates that location can significantly influence the financial success of a franchise.</p>
<br /><p>While these data sources provide valuable insights into the potential earnings of franchise owners, they should be viewed within the broader context of the franchise industry. Earnings can be influenced by the type of franchise, its geographic location, and the individual performance of franchise owners. This understanding is essential for potential franchise owners, emphasizing the need to consider these estimates as part of a comprehensive research process before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The financial compensation for franchise owners is quite different from regular salaried employment. A franchise owner’s income primarily comes from the profits of the business, which is the revenue left after all operating costs are covered. These costs include not just typical business expenses like staffing, supplies, and property maintenance but also specific franchise-related fees.</p>
<br /><p>For instance, franchisees must pay initial buy-in fees to acquire the franchise rights and ongoing royalties, which are often a percentage of the gross sales or a fixed fee. These royalties can significantly impact the overall profitability, as they are a recurring expense directly tied to the business’s revenue.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to managing these financial aspects, franchise owners are heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which includes responsibilities like hiring and training staff, maintaining the property, and ensuring adherence to the franchisor’s standards. This hands-on management is crucial, especially in the initial years when the focus is on establishing the business and recovering the initial investment.</p>
<br /><p>It’s common for franchise owners not to see substantial personal income until the business becomes firmly established, which can take a couple of years. During this period, the franchise owner’s role is to ensure the stability and growth of the business, often putting their personal salary secondary to the needs of the franchise. This startup period can be minimized by proper research and planning when deciding on the most profitable franchise for you.</p>
<br /><p>Choosing the most profitable franchise requires careful consideration and thorough research. It’s not just about brand power but also understanding the finer details that contribute to long-term success. Here are key steps to guide you in this crucial decision-making process:</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs) are loaded with information important financial information about a franchise. They provide details on everything from the company’s legal and financial history to its operational requirements. Carefully comparing the FDDs of different franchises can reveal insights into their stability, growth potential, and potential owner income.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the cost structure of a franchise is vital. Franchise fees and ongoing royalties can vary significantly and will impact your profitability. Assess these costs in relation to the value and support the franchisor provides.</p>
<br /><p>The success of a franchise heavily depends on its location and the market it serves. Investigate local market demands, competition, and economic conditions to determine the most favorable locations for your franchise.</p>
<br /><p>A realistic grasp of the operating expenses is crucial. This includes costs like rent, utilities, staffing, and inventory. Knowing these will help you calculate potential profit margins and manage cash flow effectively.</p>
<br /><p>The level of training and support a franchisor offers can greatly influence your success. Look for franchises that provide comprehensive training programs, marketing support, and ongoing assistance, as these can play a critical role in navigating challenges and driving growth.</p>

<br /><p>The post What Is MRO Procurement? + How to Optimize MRO Spending appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>If not carefully managed, MRO spending can become a financial burden for organizations of all types and sizes. However, where there are expenses, there’s also an opportunity for cost-saving measures to improve the bottom line. In this blog, we’ll look into the world of MRO procurement, uncovering the vital role it plays in businesses and how effectively managing it can be the key to financial stability and growth.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing, also known as MRO procurement, is the process of acquiring goods and services necessary for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of a business. MRO, which stands for Maintenance, Repair, and Operations, is a vital component of indirect procurement, which deals with non-production-related expenses. These purchases cover a broad spectrum of items essential to keep a company’s operations running smoothly.</p>
<br /><p>In certain industries, such as healthcare, there’s a greater emphasis on indirect procurement, including MRO purchasing, versus direct procurement. This emphasis stems from the fact that these service-based industries heavily rely on the continuous functionality of equipment and facilities. In contrast, manufacturing industries may place more emphasis on direct procurement, focusing on sourcing materials directly related to their production processes.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing encompasses a wide variety of procurement needs that are essential to the smooth and uninterrupted operation of a company. These MRO purchases can be conveniently categorized into three primary groups, each serving a distinct role in ensuring the seamless operation of a company:</p>
<br /><p>This category of MRO purchases primarily focuses on items necessary for the routine upkeep and maintenance of machinery, equipment, and facilities. It includes a range of components and supplies, such as:</p>
<br /><p>The repairs category of MRO purchases encompasses items and resources required for addressing unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions in machinery and equipment. It includes:</p>
<br /><p>The final category of MRO purchases — operations — covers services and supplies essential for the daily functioning of a business. This category includes items such as:</p>
<br /><p>Companies often face a series of challenges in the MRO procurement process, each with the potential to impact their bottom line and overall operational efficiency significantly.</p>
<br /><p>In many organizations, MRO procurement tends to be decentralized, with different departments or locations independently managing their needs. This separation can lead to inefficiencies as it often results in duplicate orders, missed opportunities for bulk purchasing discounts, and a lack of visibility into overall spending. Consequently, businesses may experience increased costs that could have been avoided with a more centralized and streamlined procurement approach.</p>
<br /><p>The complexity of managing a wide range of MRO suppliers is a common issue. Sourcing various parts, equipment, and services from multiple suppliers can become time-consuming and overwhelming. Furthermore, dealing with numerous suppliers can lead to inconsistent service levels, making it challenging to maintain reliable and efficient supply chains.</p>
<br /><p>Effective inventory control in MRO procurement is an ongoing struggle for many companies. Finding the right balance between maintaining adequate stock levels to ensure operational continuity and minimizing carrying costs is a constant challenge. Overstocked inventories tie up capital and storage space, while understocked inventories can lead to costly production disruptions. Striking this balance requires careful planning, forecasting, and demand management.</p>
<br /><p>Some MRO components are highly specialized and only needed at specific times. Managing the procurement of such specialized items can be challenging, as it requires predicting when and where these components will be required. Failing to anticipate these needs accurately can result in delays, increased downtime, and higher costs.</p>
<br /><p>To effectively manage MRO spend, businesses employ a range of strategic approaches tailored to their unique needs and challenges:</p>
<br /><p>The implementation of advanced procurement software and tools is essential in MRO strategy. These technological solutions offer enhanced visibility into procurement processes, allowing businesses to track orders, monitor inventory levels, and identify cost-saving opportunities. By leveraging technology, companies gain greater control over their MRO spend, reduce manual administrative tasks, and enhance overall efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>Many companies find value in streamlining their supplier base when it comes to MRO procurement. By reducing the number of MRO suppliers, organizations simplify supplier management, negotiation processes, and administrative tasks. This consolidation not only enhances efficiency but can also lead to better pricing agreements through increased purchasing volume.</p>
<br /><p>Leveraging data analytics has become a critical aspect of modern MRO strategy. By harnessing the power of data, businesses can make informed procurement decisions, optimize inventory levels, and anticipate future needs more accurately. Data-driven insights enable proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and mitigating the risk of emergency procurements that can be costly. Additionally, data analytics help identify trends, anomalies, and areas for cost savings within the MRO procurement process.</p>
<br /><p>One of the most effective approaches to MRO strategy is centralizing procurement. By consolidating the responsibility for MRO purchasing, companies can achieve greater consistency, better coordination, and improved cost control. Centralization fosters better alignment between departments, ensuring that MRO purchases meet the specific needs of each function. This collaborative approach enhances communication, streamlines decision-making, and ultimately results in more effective and cost-conscious procurement practices.</p>
<br /><p>These strategies collectively empower businesses to take a proactive approach to managing their MRO spend, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring the seamless operation of their facilities and equipment.</p>

This is where partnering with a specialized cost reduction consulting firm like P3 Cost Analysts becomes your strategic advantage.</p>

<br /><p>The post 15 Online Franchises You Can Run From Home appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Starting an online franchise not only brings more work-life balance, but it gives you the opportunity to run a business without many of the headaches that brick-and-mortar franchises often come with.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of starting an online franchise and provide examples of some of the best online franchises you can start this year.</p>
<br /><p>Buying into an online franchise means diving into a world where convenience meets potential. But before looking at specific options, it’s essential to consider what major benefits of starting an online franchise draw in potential business owners. Let’s explore the advantages that come with starting an online franchise.</p>
<br /><p>Instead of being tied down to a physical location, starting an online franchise allows you to essentially work from anywhere that has an internet connection. This could be a home office, coffee shop, hotel room, or any other destination you wish to work from.</p>
<br /><p>Some franchises will require you to work in the field or meet up with clients from time to time, but you’ll have the flexibility to schedule these meetings on your own time.</p>
<br /><p>This freedom of designing your schedule can be quite liberating. Whether you are a parent, caretaker, or simply have other responsibilities outside of work, starting a home-based franchise will allow you to create a life that fits your needs.</p>
<br /><p>Most online franchises require minimal employees for you to manage, while others can be run completely by yourself. Some may allow you to start out as the only operator and, once you scale and get more comfortable with the business, it would make sense to bring on the employees that you need. In all cases though, online franchises typically have management training or systems to help you manage these employees effectively.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, most online franchises have little overhead in comparison with their non-online counterparts. When you think of how employee- and cost-intensive retail or food franchises are, it makes sense for most people to run an online business.</p>
<br /><p>For a lot of work-from-home franchises, the clientele you work with will be recurring and therefore allow you to bring in predictable income. Also, depending on the type of service you offer, it might not take a ton of clients to actually meet your profit goals. Franchises with recurring revenue are especially great for those that want to work part-time while still retaining clients month after month.</p>
<br /><p>With many online franchises, you’re able to pull clients from all across the country or even the world. This allows you to scale much bigger and quicker than if you were tied down to a physical space in your local community. Furthermore, since your online business can be open 24/7, people can reach out or purchase services even while you’re sleeping.</p>
<br /><p>Starting a cost reduction franchise with P3 Cost Analysts is a great opportunity to do rewarding work in a booming industry. As a franchisee, you’ll be able to take advantage of a proven cost reduction system in order to help businesses uncover savings and improve their bottom line. You’ll have access to P3’s industry experts that have over 150 years of combined experience to help with deep auditing, while you get to focus on the growth and development of your business.</p>
<br /><p>Furthermore, you’ll undergo comprehensive training to learn all of the operational and consulting tactics needed to successfully handle your responsibilities as a franchisee. And you don’t need to worry about how you’ll get clients, as you’ll be able to leverage P3’s proven marketing system and assets. Additionally, you’ll be provided with a fully integrated suite of software that organizes and facilitates all aspects of your business.</p>
<br /><p>By starting a franchise with Chem-Dry, you’ll be joining the world’s largest and most economical carpet cleaning franchise. An estimated ten billion square feet of new carpet is installed every year and 52% of all residential floors are covered with carpet, so there is a massive opportunity for revenue in this industry. You also have the award-winning name of Chem-Dry backing your efforts.</p>
<br /><p>As a franchisee, you’ll run a territory or territories and manage a team of carpet cleaners equipped with proprietary cleaning systems and supplies from the comfort of your home office. You’ll have access to Chem-Dry’s marketing collateral which includes an SEO-optimized website, social media materials, pay-per-click advertising campaigns, and digital marketing training. Furthermore, you’ll be provided with professional CRM and analytic tools to run your business effectively.</p>
<br /><p>With many staffing and compensation challenges, outsourcing dental and healthcare billing is increasingly becoming a popular choice for small to midsize practices. For these reasons, now is a great time to start your own medical and dental billing franchise with ClaimTek Systems. You’ll be entering a recession-proof industry while being able to work from anywhere in the world. With this low overhead business model, you’ll be able to start a profitable business without breaking the bank.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees don’t need previous experience in the healthcare or dental industries and will be provided with the training needed to build credibility and a lucrative franchise. With this turn-key opportunity, you’ll be given the resources and equipment needed to service many types of practices including family medicine, internal medicine, urgent care, cardiology, mental health, dental, and more. Furthermore, ClaimTek gives you access to business development resources, marketing materials, software solutions, and 1-on-1 consulting.</p>
<br /><p>Ranked as the #1 IT franchise by Franchise Business Review and Entrepreneur Magazine, TeamLogic IT is a proven model you can leverage as a franchisee. You’ll need a passion for technology and IT, as you’ll be serving the managed IT needs of small and medium-sized businesses. Many small to midsize businesses don’t have the time or resources to handle their IT needs effectively, which means there is much opportunity for growth in this industry.</p>
<br /><p>On a day-to-day basis, you’ll learn about your clients’ businesses and their needs, manage a team of technicians, and continue to grow your business by leveraging TeamLogic IT’s sales/marketing infrastructure. You’ll have world-class support, access to business management tools, and be able to attend annual conferences designed to help you succeed with your managed IT business.</p>

<br /><p>The post DHL Refund Claims: Leaving Money on the Table? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>The most important thing for those who have contracts with DHL is to truly understand the DHL missing package and late delivery refund. Without a proper grasp of its complicated requirements, businesses are likely to leave refunds on the table.</p>
<br /><p>Just like industry counterparts UPS and FedEx, DHL provides its customers with a money-back guarantee to ensure satisfaction in the shipping process. This guarantee extends to cases where a DHL package is not delivered or is delivered later than expected. On the surface, DHL’s refund policy appears to be a reassuring safety net for businesses; however, the reality is that pursuing a refund can often become a complex and time-consuming process.</p>
<br /><p>For starters, there are some limits to the DHL services covered by the money-back guarantee. To be eligible for a DHL claim, the missing or delayed package must have been sent through one of the following services:</p>
<br /><p>The money-back guarantee represents an essential assurance for business owners who rely on DHL’s services to meet their shipping needs. It promises that compensation is on the table when expectations aren’t met due to late deliveries or lost packages. This can be particularly significant for time-sensitive deliveries or critical shipments impacting business operations.</p>
<br /><p>Nonetheless, the path to claiming a refund through DHL’s money-back guarantee isn’t always as straightforward as it may seem. DHL’s claims process is characterized by a tight time frame. For business professionals seeking a refund due to late delivery, the clock starts ticking from the moment the shipment is made. To be eligible for a DHL refund, customers are required to notify DHL of their claim within 14 calendar days from the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>The process involves several intricate steps that business owners must navigate, often demanding a certain level of familiarity with DHL’s specific procedures. In the fast-paced world of business, the time and effort required to file a claim can sometimes feel like an additional burden, diverting attention from core operations.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to the complicated DHL lost package process, the company also lists occasions in which their money-back guarantee is no longer valid. According to DHL’s website, some specific situations that are not covered include:</p>
<br /><p>In addition to these exceptions, the DHL refund only covers the rate charges for transportation costs only. It doesn’t include other charges such as fuel surcharges, fines, duties, taxes, levies, VAT, and other costs.</p>
<br /><p>After sorting through all those exceptions, we can see that DHL claims can only be filed in very specific situations. However, if a parcel you shipped with DHL shows up late or goes missing, and it is DHL’s fault, you can file a claim — and quickly. DHL claims must be filed within 14 days of the shipment date.</p>
<br /><p>Streamlining the process of filing a claim with DHL for late delivery requires a systematic approach:</p>
<br /><p>As soon as you suspect a delay in your DHL shipment, initiate the claim process. Early action can make a substantial difference in the success of your claim.</p>
<br /><p>Before reaching out to DHL, gather all necessary information, including the account number, waybill number, shipment date, and recipient details. Having these details at hand expedites the process.</p>
<br /><p>To file a claim, the customer must contact DHL via writing or telephone. When contacting DHL, be concise and clear in your communication. Provide accurate and complete information to facilitate a swift resolution.</p>
<br /><p>Maintain records of all communication, including dates, times, and details discussed. These records serve as a valuable reference in case of any follow-up.</p>

<br /><p>By adhering to DHL’s requirements, acting promptly, and ensuring accuracy, you can enhance your chances of navigating this process successfully. Keeping a watchful eye on the 14-day window and providing the requested details with precision will help you achieve a seamless and efficient resolution, ensuring your shipment concerns are addressed and your business remains on track.</p>

<br /><p>The post 8 HP Competitors and Alternatives for MPS appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Hewlett Packard (HP) is a major player in the printing domain. They’ve built a reputation for delivering quality products over the years and are a go-to for many in managed printing services. However, it’s worth noting that size and reputation don’t always translate to the best fit for every business’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Today, we will take a closer look at HP’s managed print services, their top competitors, and how your business can save money on printing.</p>
<br /><p>While HP is known for its wide array of products and services, there’s no shortage of competitors that offer very similar features. While MPS aims to save businesses money on printing, some major issues in the industry plague their effectiveness.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you’re working with HP or one of its competitors, you’re likely to run into one of the following issues:</p>
<br /><p>Many clients face billing discrepancies and lack transparency in the charges levied by major print and copier providers. The overcharges and hidden costs can lead to businesses paying more than they should.</p>
<br /><p>The standard terms and conditions in MPS contracts often favor the vendor, exposing the client to potential pitfalls. These unfavorable conditions highlight the importance of renegotiating terms to better protect the client’s interests.</p>
<br /><p>While businesses spend substantially on their print and copier services, they often don’t receive the promised service. Frequent equipment downtimes, poor support, and an overall lack of management can negatively affect a company’s operations.</p>
<br /><p>Many MPS programs are overly intricate, leading to wasted time and inefficiency for organizations. Clients are searching for programs that are not only cost-effective but also simple to understand and manage.</p>
<br /><p>With businesses spending millions on printing services annually, there’s a clear opportunity to find cost-saving solutions. While you may consider switching to one of the competitors on our list, there are other alternatives as well. For example, the quickest and most straightforward way to save money is by consulting with a company that specializes in auditing MPS invoices, such as P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>A strategic review can be immensely beneficial for businesses already utilizing managed print services, especially those whose monthly lease and print expenses exceed $10,000. Engaging with specialized MPS auditing and consulting services can shine a light on the inefficiencies, helping you navigate the contractual complexities and identifying considerable savings.</p>
<br /><p>In addition, if you’re looking for alternatives to the common players in the market, there are more tailored solutions that align with individual business objectives. Opting for consultancy is the step that transitions your print management from merely functional to optimal.</p>

<br /><p>Ricoh, founded in 1936, made significant strides when it became the first Japanese company to produce office equipment in the US in 1973. They are recognized for their multifunction printers, which stand out in quality, versatility, and advanced graphics capabilities. In comparison to other HP printer competitors, Ricoh offers a more cost-effective solution without compromising performance.

Their Managed Print Services go beyond just providing equipment; it covers supplies, maintenance, and actual usage costs. This comprehensive approach helps companies identify hidden expenses and streamline operations.</p>
<br /><p>A notable HP competitor from the US, Xerox, has been a fixture in the print industry for over a century. Originating with the development of the first plain paper photocopier, they’ve diversified into a wide range of services, including digital printing and managed print services. Their offerings, recognized for performance and cost-efficiency, present businesses with a strong HP printer alternative. With a commitment to innovation and a global footprint, Xerox stands as a formidable choice for those evaluating their print solutions.</p>
<br /><p>In the arena of HP competitors, Lexmark, headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky, has solidified its position since its inception in 1991. Catering to business and personal printing needs, Lexmark offers a range of printers and imaging products emphasizing durability and efficiency. Their commitment to sustainability and high-quality printing solutions makes them one of the best HP printer competitors for businesses around the globe. As a younger yet impactful player in the industry, Lexmark continues to be a choice worthy of consideration for those keen on optimizing their printing operations.</p>
<br /><p>Established in 1875, Toshiba is one of the oldest and most established HP competitors. With its extensive history in innovation, Toshiba has developed a rich portfolio of printing solutions tailored to meet the diverse needs of businesses globally. Their printers are renowned for reliability, efficiency, and their ability to integrate seamlessly into a variety of workflows.

<br /><p>The post Telecom Managed Service Companies: Are They Worth It? appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>So, what exactly are telecommunications managed services? Their definition and scope are ever-changing. This article offers a comprehensive look into the various components of managed telecom services. We’ll break down their functionalities, the key benefits they offer, and the alternative approaches businesses might consider.</p>
<br /><p>Keep reading to explore the role these services play in the modern business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Managed Telecom Services involve outsourcing the management and maintenance of an organization’s telecommunications infrastructure to a third-party provider. The primary objective is to let businesses concentrate on their core competencies, ensuring their telecommunications requirements are in the hands of seasoned professionals.</p>
<br /><p>Given the astonishing rate at which technology is advancing today, the role of an in-house IT department is intensifying. Keeping up with daily technological advancements is not just challenging, but it’s quickly becoming a full-time job in itself. As more and more businesses integrate high-tech solutions into their operations, the demands on the IT department build up.</p>
<br /><p>The quest for secure, reliable, and efficient connections has never been so critical. Now, when almost every business operation hinges on technology, ensuring a highly functioning telecommunications system is crucial. It’s amidst these challenges that businesses increasingly turn to Managed Telecom Services as a solution to streamline, secure, and enhance their communications infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>In an age where effective communication is the cornerstone of business success, understanding the services offered by telecom management professionals is essential. Let’s dive into the specifics of what telecom managed service providers bring to the table:</p>
<br /><p>Networks form the backbone of modern telecommunications. Managed network services ensure that both voice and data networks operate smoothly, with minimal downtime and optimal performance.</p>
<br /><p>Data drives decisions in the modern business landscape. These services encompass the storage, retrieval, and transmission of data, ensuring businesses have access to critical information when needed.</p>
<br /><p>From traditional phone lines to cutting-edge VoIP and unified communications, managed communication services ensure businesses can communicate internally and externally without any hitches.</p>
<br /><p>Managing mobile devices, apps, and networks is crucial with the rise of remote work and the need for on-the-go connectivity. These services help businesses stay connected, no matter where they are.</p>
<br /><p>Data centers are the heart of many organizations, hosting critical applications and data. These services oversee the infrastructure, ensuring high availability and performance.</p>
<br /><p>In an era of rising cyber threats, securing telecommunication infrastructures is paramount. Managed security services provide continuous monitoring, threat detection, and response measures to safeguard assets.</p>
<br /><p>The hardware that forms the foundation of telecommunications shouldn’t be overlooked. Managed IT equipment services take care of maintaining, updating, and ensuring that devices like routers, switches, servers, and other crucial components operate optimally.</p>
<br /><p>Software drives many of the functions in telecom networks, from routing calls to ensuring data security. Managed software services ensure that all software components are up-to-date, bug-free, and tailored to the organization’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring a blend of expertise, state-of-the-art tools, and proactive methodologies, offering businesses an edge in a competitive landscape. Here are some of the compelling advantages of this partnership:</p>
<br /><p>By partnering with a managed service provider, organizations can achieve significant cost savings. Instead of sustaining the expenses of an extensive in-house team or constantly updating technology, businesses can leverage the economies of scale provided by these experts.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers bring expertise that helps streamline telecom operations. Their proficiency eliminates unnecessary complexities, allowing businesses to function more smoothly and efficiently.</p>
<br /><p>With the technical aspects of IT and telecommunications managed externally, internal staff can center their efforts on the organization’s core objectives. This focus ensures that staff productivity remains high and is unhampered by tech-related distractions.</p>
<br /><p>Outsourcing management means issues like compatibility across cloud applications, performance challenges, and rapid service development are taken care of by the service provider. Organizations can thus remain confident in the reliability and scalability of their tech infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>Managed service providers offer solutions tailored to the unique requirements and goals of each business. This customization ensures that the technology infrastructure and services align perfectly with the organization’s objectives.</p>
<br /><p>Constant oversight is a hallmark of professionally managed service providers. They not only provide 24/7 monitoring but also offer insights through regular performance tracking, enabling informed strategic decision-making.</p>
<br /><p>There is another side to the coin. Telecom managed service providers come with their own set of expenses. So, what’s the alternative? Cost reduction firms like P3 Cost Analysts specialize in telecom auditing, finding discrepancies in billing, and ensuring businesses only pay for what they use. Here’s what P3 brings to the table:</p>
<br /><p>The P3 model focuses on transparency and saving money rather than additional expenses. For businesses tight on budget or looking for efficiency, P3 provides a compelling alternative.</p>
<br /><p>Take, for instance, a recent case study involving a school system. Despite the client paying optimal rates, P3 identified a billing error that had persisted for years. Upon extensive negotiation, the client was rewarded with a hefty refund check of $150,000 and a monthly bill reduction of over $3,000.</p>
<br /><p>This scenario underscores P3’s diligent commitment to ensuring clients are only billed for what they should be.</p>
<br /><p>In our exploration of Telecom Managed Services, we’ve seen how they present a comprehensive solution for businesses, addressing every aspect of telecommunication needs. These services offer an array of benefits, from streamlining operations to enhancing technological infrastructure.</p>
<br /><p>While these advantages are clear, it’s crucial for organizations to assess their unique needs and financial landscape. Many will find that the financial inspection provided by a telecom audit company, such as P3 Cost Analysts, aligns more seamlessly with their end goals.</p>

<br /><p>The post What Is Liquid Capital for a Franchise? (+ How to Get It) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we’re going to take a closer look at one of the key components in determining if a franchise opportunity will work for you – liquid capital. Understanding the concept of liquid capital, how much you need, and how to get it for your franchise is crucial to start your entrepreneurial journey. So, let’s dive into the details!</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital, often referred to as liquid assets, is any asset that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without losing its value. In regards to opening a franchise, liquid capital is essentially your ready-to-use funds that can be utilized immediately for any necessary expenses.</p>
<br /><p>So, what does liquid capital mean for potential franchisees? It’s easy to confuse liquid capital with the amount due to the franchisor. While the total liquid capital required for a franchisee certainly encompasses costs to cover the franchise fee, it also extends to other startup expenses necessary to kickstart the business. These costs may include rent or real estate, training, inventory, and additional overheads.</p>
<br /><p>Another common misconception among franchisees is thinking that liquid capital and net worth are the same thing. Net worth is the cumulative total of both liquid (easily convertible to cash) and illiquid assets (assets that are not readily convertible to cash). In contrast, liquid capital, as highlighted in the examples below, includes only those assets that can be swiftly converted into cash.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the difference between liquid capital and net worth is crucial when planning your franchise investment. More importantly, it helps you guarantee that you can meet the minimum liquid capital requirements of the franchise opportunity you’re interested in.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to acquiring a franchise, potential franchisees should be aware of various sources of liquid capital at their disposal. Let’s look at some of the most common examples.</p>
<br /><p>At the top of the list of liquid capital examples is cash or the balance you have in your savings account. This cash can be quickly and easily used for any immediate business needs.</p>
<br /><p>Stocks, bonds, and other marketable securities also qualify as liquid capital. Their value lies in their marketability – they can be sold on the stock exchange, providing a quick influx of cash when required. However, it’s important to remember that the selling price is dependent on the market conditions at the time of sale.</p>
<br /><p>Mutual funds, essentially pools of diversified investments, constitute another form of liquid capital. Despite the complexity of these investments, they can typically be sold within a few business days, transforming into cash at hand.</p>
<br /><p>Similar to mutual funds, money market funds are a type of investment fund. They are considered highly liquid due to their short-term nature. This allows for quick conversion to cash, further adding to your liquid capital.</p>
<br /><p>While understanding what counts as liquid capital is integral to your franchise investment journey, it’s equally important to recognize non-liquid assets. Non-liquid capital refers to assets that cannot be quickly converted into cash without potentially losing value. Here are some common examples:</p>
<br /><p>Properties, whether residential or commercial, fall under the category of non-liquid capital. Despite their considerable value, they can’t be quickly or easily sold without the risk of a price drop. Real estate transactions can take weeks or even months to complete, which doesn’t offer the immediate accessibility that liquid capital does.</p>
<br /><p>Items like art, antiques, rare coins, or other collectibles are also considered non-liquid capital. While they may hold value, finding a buyer willing to pay that value can be a time-consuming process, making them a less optimal source of capital.</p>
<br /><p>Machinery, vehicles, or other equipment related to your business or personal use are also forms of non-liquid capital. Although these assets might be highly valuable, selling them for their true worth could be challenging and time-consuming, hence their classification as non-liquid.</p>
<br /><p>For individuals below retirement age, retirement accounts generally fall under non-liquid assets. Despite their substantial value, accessing these funds early can invite penalties and tax implications, making them less ideal as a source of liquid capital for a franchise investment.</p>
<br /><p>Potential investors often focus on the initial franchise fee when considering buying a franchise. However, the financial aspect of owning a franchise extends far beyond this initial payment. Franchises generally set a minimum liquid capital requirement for potential franchisees. This ensures that they possess the requisite financial backing, not just for the initial purchase but also to sustain the franchise until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>The term “liquid capital” might vary in definition across franchises. Some may have a more expansive interpretation of what assets count as liquid, while others might be more restrictive. It’s essential to thoroughly understand and align with the specific definitions set by the franchise you’re considering by reading over the Franchise Disclosure Document.</p>
<br /><p>Beyond the initial investment, franchises come with various startup costs, from leasing space and acquiring inventory to training staff and launching marketing initiatives. Furthermore, achieving profitability in a new business doesn’t happen overnight. There might be a period where expenses surpass revenue, especially in the initial stages. During such times, liquid capital acts as a financial safety net, ensuring the business can continue its operations uninterrupted. It provides the franchisee with a buffer to navigate early challenges, making it a crucial aspect of the franchising journey.</p>
<br /><p>In general, most franchises will have a minimum requirement of $50,000 in liquid assets. However, some demand much more. For instance, the P3 Cost Analysts franchise has a relatively low cash minimum of $59,500. Meanwhile, other franchise opportunities will differ. KFC, for example, requires potential franchisees to have $750,000 in liquid assets.</p>
<br /><p>However, it’s essential to ensure that diving into a franchise doesn’t put you in a bad spot financially. Maintaining a cushion for personal expenses and unforeseen business challenges is crucial. Though thorough research and due diligence can help in selecting a promising franchise, there’s an inherent risk in starting a business. Therefore, it’s wise to ensure you have enough liquid capital in reserve to pay personal bills and expenses during the initial phases when profitability might not be immediate.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you are planning to buy a franchise or are just starting your research, you might be wondering, “How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?” If your money isn’t easily accessible in your savings accounts, you may have convertible assets that can add to your total available. Here are a few options to consider:</p>
<br /><p>This is the most straightforward way to accumulate liquid capital. By saving a portion of your income over time, you can build up your liquid capital reserves without borrowing or selling assets.</p>
<br /><p>If you have personal assets such as valuable collectibles or equipment, you could sell these to generate liquid capital. However, this should be done with caution as it could have tax implications and also reduce your net worth.</p>
<br /><p>Tapping into your home’s equity through a HELOC can provide ready funds. As you repay your mortgage and your property’s value increases, you accumulate equity, which can be borrowed against for liquid capital. This option often has lower interest rates than other loans, but remember, your home serves as the collateral. If you can’t pay back the loan, you risk losing your property.</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, you might have family members or friends willing to invest in your franchise business. However, this option should be approached carefully to avoid any future disagreements or strained relationships.</p>
<br /><p>How does liquid capital work?</p>
<br /><p>Liquid capital refers to assets that can be quickly and easily converted into cash without significant loss in value. In the context of business, it represents readily available funds that can be used to cover immediate and short-term needs, such as payroll, rent, and inventory.</p>
<br /><p>How do you get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Two common ways to gather liquid capital for a franchise include tapping into personal savings or selling personal assets, such as stocks, collectibles, or valuable equipment.</p>
<br /><p>Is a 401k considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>While a 401k holds value and can be accessed, it’s not typically classified as liquid capital because withdrawing funds early can result in penalties and tax consequences. However, using strategies like Rollover for Business Startups (ROBS), individuals can tap into their 401k to finance a franchise without penalties.</p>
<br /><p>Is a loan considered liquid capital?</p>
<br /><p>Some franchisors do not regard borrowed money as liquid capital. This is because loans come with the obligation of repayment, which can impact the financial stability of the franchisee.</p>
<br /><p>Is a house a liquid asset?</p>
<br /><p>Generally, a house is a non-liquid asset. Selling it to convert it into cash can be time-consuming and depends on current market conditions.</p>
<br /><p>How to get liquid capital for a franchise?</p>
<br /><p>Acquiring liquid assets can be done by building up personal savings over time or by selling personal assets like stocks or collectibles.</p>
<br /><p>Choosing franchises with minimal buy-in requirements, such as P3 Cost Analysts, can ease financial pressures. With reasonable franchise costs, startup expenses, and overheads, it’s a financially accessible venture that still allows for a healthy ROI.</p>
<br /><p>Yet, low startup costs do not imply a lack of support. At P3, affordability and support go hand in hand. Each franchisee is equipped with comprehensive tools, training, and resources to ensure their success. The balance of low initial investment and a robust backing system positions P3 Cost Analysts as a high-value, low-barrier entry into the world of franchising.</p>

By comprehending what constitutes liquid capital, its importance, and ways to acquire it, you’re better positioned to make informed decisions.</p>

<br /><p>The post Are Franchises a Good Investment? (Hint: It Depends) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s cut through the noise and look into the practical aspects of franchising, examining the potential rewards, risks, and factors determining whether owning a franchise is profitable.</p>
<br /><p>A franchise is a business arrangement where an individual (franchisee) is granted the right to operate a business using an established company’s branding, products, and services (franchisor). This arrangement forms a partnership between the two parties, allowing the franchisee to replicate a proven business model with the guidance and support of the franchisor. Some common franchises that you’ve surely seen in your day-to-day life include 711 and Subway.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike starting a business from scratch, where there are many uncertainties and challenges, a franchise presents a more calculated investment. The franchisor’s track record, successful business practices, and standardized systems significantly reduce some of the inherent risks of entrepreneurship. Investors are essentially tapping into a model that has already demonstrated its viability, making the endeavor a strategic combination of investment and business pursuit.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees earn money by selling products and services within their franchised business. While sales are the primary income source, the process involves additional financial components. For instance, franchise owners pay the franchisor a franchise fee and ongoing royalties. Operating a business comes with its own set of costs as well. After accounting for all these factors, franchisees typically see a portion of the profit as their earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise costs vary widely depending on the brand, industry, and scale of the business. The initial investment encompasses the franchise fee, which could be as low as $10,000 for smaller, home-based franchises and can exceed $2 million for well-established and prominent brands.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, there are other startup expenses such as equipment, inventory, and location setup. It’s crucial to thoroughly review the franchise’s Financial Disclosure Document (FDD) to understand all costs involved before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The FDD can also help potential franchisees get a better idea of the possible return on investment (ROI) of the franchise. For example, some franchises, like McDonald’s, may require startup costs over $1 million. However, their potential for profit is also relatively high.</p>
<br /><p>Alternatively, entrepreneurs may opt for a franchise with lower initial costs but potentially similar ROI as McDonald’s.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can indeed be a wise investment decision, particularly due to their array of inherent advantages that mitigate risks and increase the potential for profitability.</p>
<br /><p>The allure of a franchise lies in its established and proven business model. Franchisors have fine-tuned their operations over time, optimizing strategies that have shown success across various locations. This proven blueprint provides franchisees with a head start, allowing them to bypass the uncertainties and trial-and-error typically associated with starting an independent business.</p>
<br /><p>A significant hurdle for new businesses is building brand recognition and trust. Franchises overcome this challenge by offering franchisees immediate access to a widely recognized and trusted brand. This brand recognition can significantly reduce the time and effort required to attract customers and establish a foothold in the market.</p>
<br /><p>Unlike independent startups, franchisees benefit from a network of resources, ongoing support, and comprehensive training provided by the franchisor. This support extends from initial setup to daily operations, guiding franchisees through challenges and helping them navigate the business landscape.</p>
<br /><p>Franchises often pool resources for marketing and advertising campaigns. This collective effort boosts brand visibility and customer engagement, benefiting all franchisees within the network. Such campaigns can encompass anything from national TV advertisements to local social media initiatives.</p>
<br /><p>While franchises offer these compelling benefits, it’s important to remember that each investment decision should be well-informed and aligned with individual goals and circumstances. Thorough research, careful consideration, and seeking professional advice will help potential franchisees to decide if franchising is worth it for them.</p>
<br /><p>Yes, franchises can be profitable, but profitability depends on various factors such as the industry, location, management, the franchisee, and the specific franchise itself. Thorough research, adaptability, and a keen understanding of the local landscape are pivotal in transforming the potential for profit into reality within the world of franchising.</p>
<br /><p>While there are so many factors at play, it’s impossible to give an exact number for the potential income of a franchise owner. Franchisors won’t make any profitability promises to avoid potential litigation down the line. They may, however, offer information on the financial performance of other franchise locations.</p>
<br /><p>According to Top Franchise, the average annual income for typical franchisees is around $80,000 before factoring in taxes and expenses. While a minority of franchise owners exceed $200,000 in yearly earnings, a majority earn approximately $50,000. Of course, the profitability can vary based on your industry.</p>
<br /><p>Making the decision to invest in a franchise is a significant step toward entrepreneurship. While franchises offer a host of benefits, it’s crucial to navigate this path with strategic planning. The following are some of the essential factors to focus on when considering “Are franchises worth it?”</p>
<br /><p>When considering a franchise, align your choice with your personal strengths and passions. Your commitment and enthusiasm are crucial for long-term success. Choose a franchise that resonates with your skills and interests, increasing your chances of dedicated involvement.</p>
<br /><p>Conduct thorough market research to assess the demand for the franchise’s products or services in your chosen location. Analyzing the competition, demographics, and market trends will provide valuable insights into the potential for success.</p>
<br /><p>Evaluate your financial readiness to invest in a franchise. Beyond the initial investment, consider working capital, ongoing royalties, and operational costs. Financial planning is key to sustaining the business until it becomes profitable.</p>
<br /><p>Research the franchisor’s reputation within the industry and among franchisees. Speak with existing franchisees to gather insights into their experiences. A reputable franchisor is more likely to provide the support and resources necessary for success.</p>

<br /><p>The post 15 Best Low-Cost Franchises With High Profit & ROI appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>While some might assume that franchises always come with a high price tag, there are actually numerous franchise opportunities that are not only affordable but also promise a substantial return on investment.</p>
<br /><p>We’ve compiled a list of 15 such franchises, spanning sectors from cost reduction consulting to senior care and education. If you’re looking to dive into a business with both manageable upfront costs and a strong potential for profit, this list might have the perfect opportunity for you.</p>
<br /><p>Franchises, as a whole, offer budding entrepreneurs a head start in the world of business. Instead of starting from scratch, franchises provide a proven business model, brand recognition, and an established customer base. This means that the journey to profitability is often faster and more reliable than building a business from the ground up. Investors are equipped with training, support, and a roadmap, greatly reducing the uncertainty and risk that can plague new, independent ventures.</p>
<br /><p>However, many of the well-known franchise opportunities come with a hefty price tag, making them inaccessible to a large portion of aspiring business owners. This is where the allure of low-cost franchises with high profits comes in. Contrary to popular belief, low investment doesn’t mean low return. In fact, many low-overhead franchises offer returns that rival, if not surpass, their high-ticket counterparts. For those eager to start their entrepreneurial journey on a budget, these franchises represent not just affordability but also a promising path to success.</p>

<br /><p>The best thing about it though is that all you really have to excel at is sales; you find the clients and the franchisor provides the expert team who analyses your clients’ expenses and finds ways for them to save money, so you don’t even need to be a maths pro.</p>

<br /><p>The goal is obviously a low-cost franchise with high-profit returns, so to choose one you need to check off some boxes to ensure the franchise you decide on has the best possible chance of success.</p>
<br /><p>Make sure the franchisor has a proven support system for franchisees, specifically with regards to marketing because that is what will make or break your business.</p>
<br /><p>For example, does the franchisor advertise the brand? Do they make it easy for people to know about the business?</p>
<br /><p>The marketing and brand are what you are paying for most, so it is critical that they’ve mastered this particular aspect. The marketing they do for the brand as a whole is of the utmost importance, as well as the support they give to franchisees, otherwise, you are wasting your money by investing in a franchise business instead of starting up from scratch.</p>
<br /><p>It is important to know if there is a demand for the products or services they sell, and if products or services are offered in specific locations, is there a demand for them there?</p>
<br /><p>The product could be exceptional, but there is a possibility that if it’s in the wrong location, the business could flop. Request this information from the franchisor. Another good way of determining demand is by doing a simple Google Trends search to find out if people in the area are searching for those products.</p>
<br /><p>It’s also a good idea to analyze the competition for the product or service—that may give you a good idea of what it takes to be successful.</p>
<br /><p>Check nationwide the number of locations and annual revenue. It may also be a good idea to have some conversations with other franchisees.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Direct offers another valuable tip: the best way to determine a franchise’s future profitability is by analyzing Item 19 of the franchise’s FDD (franchise disclosure document), which outlines the business’s financial performance. It may be beneficial to consult an accountant or lawyer to fully understand this.</p>
<br /><p>Only consider the franchises whose initial fee and upfront investments are realistic for your current financial situation; this may be another discussion to have with an accountant or lawyer.</p>
<br /><p>There may be hidden costs, personal financial necessities, or royalties, so reading the fine print is essential.</p>
<br /><p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly: Is what’s required of you something you will enjoy doing, and do you believe in the core offering? For most people, using their top skills is what’s going to fulfill them on a daily basis.</p>
<br /><p>Armed with this knowledge, there are several franchises that meet the above requirements and are also low-investment, high-return franchises.</p>
<br /><p>Every entrepreneur aims for a high return on investment (ROI) when stepping into the business world. While initiating a venture from scratch offers a certain allure, franchising often presents a more secure route to achieving that desired high ROI with lower startup costs. With the foundation of a proven system and established methodologies, a franchise can significantly amplify your potential returns.</p>

<br /><p>The post Top 10 Recession-Proof Businesses in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Savvy entrepreneurs understand that waiting for the “perfect” moment to start a business is futile. A better tactic is to opt for a company that can withstand the test of time and economic downturns by choosing recession-proof industries.</p>
<br /><p>In this blog, we’ll explore ten recession-proof business ideas that can offer the potential for lasting success and stability, regardless of the economic climate. Let’s dive into these opportunities and discover how specific businesses that do well in a recession can provide peace of mind for entrepreneurs in both prosperous and challenging times.</p>
<br /><p>A recession-proof business is one that is not as heavily impacted by the economic effects of a recession, typically stemming from industries that provide basic needs. Because they offer needed products and services, they are the last industries to be affected by changes in consumer spending.</p>
<br /><p>To be clear, there is no such thing as a fully recession-proof business. Every recession is completely different and impossible to predict. For example, the real estate market crashed in 2008 but actually thrived during the early 2000s recession. However, some recession-proof industries are much more likely to weather the storm, regardless of what causes the economy to falter.</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses are those found in sectors that thrive even during economic downturns, such as:</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses typically cater to non-negotiable needs, offering products or services that people cannot easily forgo. By providing essential solutions, these businesses ensure their relevance and demand even during economic downturns.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, sustaining affordable prices plays a crucial role in their resilience during challenging times. When consumers become more budget-conscious in recessions, businesses offering competitive pricing are generally better positioned to retain customers and maintain a steady revenue stream.</p>
<br /><p>Regardless of how the economy looks when you decide to start your own business, setting yourself up with a recession-proof business is a solid plan. You never know what the future holds, and these business ideas can give you some assurance now and for years to come.</p>
<br /><p>The automotive services industry includes all post-purchase services necessary to keep a car in working order, such as oil changes, tire repairs, air conditioning, electrical inspections, plus body repair, painting, and much more.</p>
<br /><p>The market is expected to register a 3 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years and reach a value of $76.91 billion by 2027.</p>
<br /><p>If people aren’t out buying new cars, you can best believe they’re doing everything they can to take care of the ones they have. Cars inevitably need maintenance as they age and have more miles put on them, even during a recession. Plus, as long as the freight industry continues to remain strong, there will be a need for servicing big rigs and delivery trucks.</p>
<br /><p>Times have changed, and more and more families have two working parents, whether out of necessity or personal preference. Paid childcare services provide supervision, care, and sometimes education to infants and young children.</p>
<br /><p>Childcare services were valued at $54.3 billion in 2019 and will continue to grow. From 2020 to 2027, there is an expected compound annual growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
<br /><p>During a recession, parents may have to work longer hours or even more than one job. While historically expensive, childcare services are still one of the last costs parents abandon. Not to mention they usually make up a significant part of their budget. It’s not just about a safe place to leave your child while you’re at work. For many, it’s the first step of their growth and education.</p>
<br /><p>The real estate industry involves the sale of land, residential, commercial, and industrial properties. But, there are other businesses involving real estate that may also thrive during a recession, like property management or investment firms.</p>
<br /><p>Zillow Group expects that home value will continue to rise, going up 7.8 percent in the next 12 months.</p>
<br /><p>It might surprise you to see real estate on our list when you consider the Great Recession. However, historically speaking, a recession does not always mean the housing market will crash. As of right now, home prices continue to soar, but even if prices drop, it may be the perfect opportunity for investors.</p>
<br /><p>While prices fluctuate short term, the sector is usually more stable in the long run. Real estate even proved to be one of the most pandemic-proof businesses as the housing market boomed.</p>
<br /><p>Millions of businesses and firms seek outside help regarding accounting and other financial information services, as do individuals. With rules and regulations getting more complicated and confusing, consulting experts seems to be the go-to move. Services offered include tax preparation, bookkeeping, and invoice outsourcing.</p>
<br /><p>Worldwide, the financial services market grew from $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<br /><p>Even if the economy slows down, it never comes to a full halt. In fact, financial services drive the economy. So, many financial and accounting services continue to do well during hard times.</p>
<br /><p>Home improvement services encompass a wide range of offerings aimed at enhancing and maintaining residential properties. These services can include renovations, remodeling, repairs, and upgrades to various areas of a home, such as kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, roofing, and more. Whether homeowners want to increase their property’s value, create a more comfortable living space, or address necessary repairs, the home improvement industry caters to their diverse needs.</p>
<br /><p>The home improvement industry accounted for $538 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach more than $620 billion by 2025.</p>
<br /><p>Certain services this industry provides, such as HVAC repair, electric, and home repair, are necessary even during a recession. AC units don’t care about the economic situation, but many Americans live in areas where you simply cannot live without it. Damaged roofs, leaking pipes, and other issues will still need to be repaired immediately. Home improvement also turned out to be a covid-proof business. With people stuck at home, many decided to fix up their houses.</p>
<br /><p>Americans sure do love their pets. The animal care industry is massive and covers many different categories, including medical care, toys, daycare, and more. As people become more educated on animals’ needs and welfare, they are highly aware of where they put their money when it comes to their pets.</p>
<br /><p>The global pet care market is expected to grow to more than 325 billion by 2028, with dog products and services pulling in the highest revenues.</p>
<br /><p>If you believe everything you read on the internet, millennials have canceled having children and are having pets instead. Especially after the pandemic, the pet industry is breaking records, and proper pet care is not something most people are willing to forgo when money gets tight.</p>
<br /><p>Business consulting includes a broad range of professional services other companies need help with, such as strategy, market research, or public relations. Consultants or consulting firms are meant to help their clients by solving specific problems or issues, often saving them money.</p>
<br /><p>From freelancers to large firms, consulting businesses are generating up to $300 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<br /><p>Consulting businesses can stay afloat during recessions because of their ability to be flexible and adapt to market situations. If companies are struggling to make money and you can help them create growth or optimize during a recession, they will want to keep you around. Plus, staying profitable will be much easier with no inventory and little overhead.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS market has grown at insane speeds over the past ten years and isn’t likely to slow down. Software as a service is delivered via the internet rather than installing complicated software and hardware. As a cloud-based service, the ease, scalability, and security are high, and users typically pay a monthly or yearly fee.</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth is expected to continue, with the market estimated to be worth about $208 billion in 2023, with US companies leading the way.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS industry is another with little to no overhead, making them easier for businesses to maintain during a recession. In addition, many of these software are fully integrated into business processes, so companies can’t afford to ditch them during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>The healthcare industry includes a wide range of services, from hospitals and medical clinics to pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers. The healthcare sector is dedicated to promoting, maintaining, and restoring human health through medical and therapeutic interventions.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, the healthcare market is expected to reach nearly $59 billion in 2023 and show an annual growth rate of 10.4 percent in the years to come.</p>
<br /><p>Healthcare is a fundamental need that people cannot do without, regardless of the economic situation. During a recession, individuals may cut back on unnecessary spending, but they will continue to seek medical care when necessary. Moreover, the recent global pandemic has highlighted the significance of pandemic-proof businesses in the healthcare industry. The ability to provide essential medical services, telehealth consultations, and innovative solutions while adapting to rapidly changing circumstances has highlighted the industry’s resilience.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, in 2020, about 16.9 percent of the United States population was 65 or older. By 2030, that percentage is projected to reach 20.6 percent. This demographic shift emphasizes the demand for senior services for this growing population segment.</p>
<br /><p>Senior services may include a range of businesses that cater to the needs of the elderly population. As people age, they may require assistance with daily activities, healthcare, companionship, and other specialized services to maintain a high quality of life.</p>
<br /><p>The aging population’s continuous growth has led to an increased need for senior services, making this one of the most recession-proof industries. For many elderly individuals, these services are crucial for their well-being and safety, ensuring their relevance even during economic downturns. Additionally, the expansion of retirement communities and assisted living facilities opens up further opportunities for entrepreneurs in this field.</p>
<br /><p>Starting an entire business from scratch can be costly, take a while to get things moving, and have no guarantee of success after all your hard work and dedication. A recession-proof franchise can take a lot of the guesswork out of the equation and help you get your business up and running much faster.</p>
<br /><p>Franchising offers a proven business model with established brand recognition, training, and ongoing support from the franchisor. By investing in a recession-proof franchise, such as one with P3 Cost Analysts, you can leverage the expertise and experience of a well-established brand, increasing your chances of success even during challenging economic times. Additionally, as part of a larger network, you can benefit from collective buying power, marketing resources, and shared knowledge.</p>
<br /><p>In uncertain economic times, having a recession-proof business can provide stability and security. The listed recession-proof business ideas cover various industries, from automotive services and child care to real estate and healthcare. By identifying essential products that people will continue to seek even during a recession, you can position your business for long-term success.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re looking for an opportunity for business ownership in a sector that will thrive during all economic conditions, a cost reduction consulting franchise with P3 Cost Analysts could be the right move. If you have a passion for helping other business owners and want to help them cut costs during a recession, then you would shine with a cost reduction consulting franchise.</p>

<br /><p>The post Top Last Mile Delivery Companies and Startups in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>This article will explore the top last mile delivery companies and startups this year, shedding light on established industry leaders and emerging disruptors. Whether you’re looking for reliable global logistics giants or innovative local players, this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of last mile logistics.</p>
<br /><p>Last mile delivery is the final stage and arguably the most important part of the logistics process. This leg of the delivery process refers to when goods are transported from a distribution or fulfillment center to the customer’s doorstep. It is the crucial link between businesses and consumers. Last mile delivery plays a significant role in customer satisfaction and the overall success of e-commerce and retail operations.</p>
<br /><p>The process from customer purchase to last mile delivery looks something like this. First, a customer places an order, usually through an online retailer. The company then processes, packs, and prepares the item for shipment from its fulfillment center. At this point, the delivery vehicle will collect the product. Last mile delivery may be handled by the company themselves, such as with Amazon, or via a third party. Either way, the shipper is responsible for optimizing delivery routes for efficiency. Once the package has been delivered, the driver marks the order as complete.</p>
<br /><p>In recent years, the growth of e-commerce has led to an increased emphasis on last mile delivery services. Customers now expect faster, more convenient, and more flexible delivery options. E-commerce giants like Amazon have placed pressure on smaller companies to keep up with these advancements.</p>
<br /><p>While Amazon handles its own shipping needs, other businesses often rely on third-party last mile delivery companies to ship their products. These providers have responded to growing industry pressure by adopting innovative technologies – such as route optimization software, tracking systems, and delivery drones or robots – to streamline their last mile operations. In addition to the major players, we are now seeing startup companies looking to disrupt the industry, as well as software to help businesses optimize their shipping processes.</p>
<br /><p>Industry trends in last mile logistics mirror those of many other industries. As technology advances, people prioritize sustainability, and the demands of consumers evolve, each sector must adapt.</p>
<br /><p>Each year, the technological advancements in the industry continue to surprise us. One trend that is taking the industry by storm is robotics and automation. Self-driving delivery vehicles, drones, and other autonomous vehicles can not only lower costs and improve delivery times but also improve traffic issues. Additional technological advancements include AI route optimization, real-time communication tools, and GPS tracking systems.</p>
<br /><p>Sustainability has become a key focus in the last mile delivery sector. With increasing environmental concerns and pressure from the masses, companies are adopting more sustainable practices to reduce carbon emissions. This includes the use of electric vehicles and alternative fuel sources, as well as optimizing delivery routes to minimize fuel consumption. Some companies are also exploring more localized fulfillment operations, utilizing eco-friendly packaging materials, and implementing recycling programs to reduce waste.</p>
<br /><p>Enhancing the customer experience is a top priority for last mile delivery providers. Real-time tracking systems allow customers to monitor the progress of their deliveries and receive accurate estimated arrival times. Delivery notifications through SMS or mobile apps enable customers to plan their schedules accordingly. Moreover, personalized delivery options, such as choosing delivery time windows or designated safe drop-off locations, contribute to a more convenient and satisfying customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>The demand for faster deliveries, including same-day and on-demand services, has grown significantly. Last mile delivery providers are adapting to this trend by offering expedited delivery options. Some companies have developed networks of local couriers or crowd-sourced drivers to fulfill immediate delivery requests. Additionally, partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores or lockers enable customers to pick up or return orders at convenient locations.</p>
<br /><p>These well-established industry leaders have built a strong reputation and extensive networks in the last mile delivery space. With their focus on optimization, reliability, and innovative solutions, they have set the benchmark for efficient and effective delivery services.</p>
<br /><p>UPS, a renowned global logistics company that rakes in nearly 100 billion in annual revenue, specializes in last mile delivery services. It places significant emphasis on optimizing its last mile capabilities through strategic partnerships and technology integration. UPS’s commitment to efficient and reliable last mile delivery has contributed to its strong presence in the industry.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx distinguishes itself from other last mile delivery services through its extensive global network and comprehensive range of services. With a strong focus on reliability and speed, FedEx offers express delivery solutions that enable businesses to meet tight deadlines.

<br /><p>The post 8 Best Recession-Proof Franchises in 2024 appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>One way entrepreneurs can maintain financial stability and even grow their wealth amidst a recession is by starting a recession-proof franchise. The support and community of a franchise allow its franchisees to not only survive but also thrive and adapt more easily than other types of businesses during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we will explore which industries succeed during a recession and provide some examples of recession-proof franchises you can start this year.</p>
<br /><p>A recession occurs when there is a major drop in economic activity across sectors lasting for a significant period of time. Therefore, a recession-proof business is one that can continue to succeed amidst these uncertain economic conditions.</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses operate in industries that provide essential products and services that people and businesses will need regardless of the economic climate. While the overall economy may be in a decline, recession-proof businesses will survive and or thrive during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>Industries that thrive during a recession are those that deliver products or services that people will pay for even when money is tight. In the list below, we explore some of the main industries that continue to thrive during a recession, followed by some of the best franchises available in each.</p>
<br /><p>When businesses are struggling during a recession, they turn to business consultants to help them reduce and optimize their spending. Businesses of all sizes can benefit from the advice of a third-party consultant. Depending on the type of consulting you want to do, you could help businesses with cost reduction, performance management, operational logistics, and much more.</p>
<br /><p>Whether we’re in a recession or not, things are bound to break. And when money is already tight due to a recession, people are more likely to repair their things versus buying new ones. That’s why various types of repair service businesses are able to succeed during a recession. Businesses that specialize in auto repair, plumbing, roofing, HVAC, and other trades are likely to maintain a steady stream of work during economic downturns.</p>
<br /><p>The senior population is on the rise and will continue to rise for years to come. With many of these seniors preferring to stay at their current residence versus moving to an assisted living facility as they age, the demand for in-home senior care will continue to grow regardless of economic conditions.</p>
<br /><p>Even when the economy is in a downturn, commercial spaces still need to be cleaned. Though many companies now allow a large portion of their employees to work from home, their offices still need to be cleaned for the employees that do work in the office. Our current pandemic has also put an emphasis on sanitation and cleanliness, which makes commercial cleaning services a lucrative industry to be in during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>One thing for certain is that people will always need to eat and drink regardless of economic conditions. Though many people will cut back on their food and beverage budgets, they will still spend what they can on these items. Additionally, when times are tough, people may look at snacks or alcoholic beverages as “affordable luxuries” during a time when they aren’t spending their money on other non-essential items. Businesses such as grocery stores, convenience stores, and liquor stores all tend to fare well during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>Businesses rely on technology and a variety of different devices for their daily operations. Even when the economy is on the decline, businesses and individuals need their technology infrastructure and devices serviced and repaired on an ongoing basis. For these reasons, the IT services industry is well-positioned to handle any type of economic climate.</p>
<br /><p>Even in the midst of economic downturns, one industry that remains remarkably resilient is pet services. This is because pets are more than just animals to their owners – they are cherished family members. From pet grooming and boarding to training and veterinary care, the demand for pet services remains steady throughout economic fluctuations. People continue to invest in their pets’ health, happiness, and socialization needs, as they consider it an essential part of their overall quality of life.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to the education industry, focusing on children’s learning and development can offer many recession-proof franchise ideas. The value placed on children’s education remains unwavering even during economic downturns, as parents prioritize investing in their children’s future. Franchises that specialize in educational services for kids, such as tutoring centers, enrichment programs, and early childhood education, are well-positioned to thrive.</p>
<br /><p>By becoming a franchisee with P3 Cost Analysts, you’ll be able to help businesses reduce spending while building a business in a growing industry. P3 provides comprehensive training and support in order to position franchisees for success with all of their cost reduction consulting responsibilities.</p>

<br /><p>The in-home senior care market is booming with no sign of slowing down. As a franchisee with Visiting Angels, you’ll be able to capitalize on this growing market while providing rewarding services to seniors in need.</p>
<br /><p>Our aging population will always need proper care, thus, you can feel confident that your business can grow during all types of economic conditions. Additionally, you’ll have access to Visiting Angel’s extensive support and training to ensure your success.</p>
<br /><p>Hospitals, offices, retail stores, schools, and other commercial buildings all need to be cleaned on a regular basis. By starting a franchise with 360clean, you’ll be able to keep these buildings clean and hygienic while creating a profitable business.</p>
<br /><p>This turnkey opportunity is on trend with the increased need for sanitation due to the pandemic and will continue to be a much-needed service in all economic conditions. Furthermore, you’ll have access to 360clean’s proven marketing system to secure a steady pipeline of clients.</p>
<br /><p>7-Eleven is one of the top convenience store franchises in the world. With a respected name behind you and a proven business model, you’ll be able to start a profitable business that provides essential items for customers.</p>
<br /><p>7-Eleven is committed to providing its franchisees with ongoing support in the form of training, implementing innovative services, and world-class marketing assets.</p>
<br /><p>TeamLogic IT is consistently ranked one of the top managed IT franchises in the country. This proven business model allows you to service the IT needs of small and medium-sized businesses alike.</p>
<br /><p>As a franchisee, you’ll be providing much-needed services to businesses that simply don’t have the resources or knowledge base in order to keep their technology infrastructure secure and operational. You’ll also have access to best-in-class business management tools and support.</p>
<br /><p>Pet Supplies Plus is a standout recession-resistent franchise in the pet industry. With approximately 70 percent of Americans owning pets, the demand for essential pet supplies remains steady even during economic downturns. Regardless of a recession, pet owners must provide necessary supplies like food, grooming products, toys, and healthcare items to ensure their pets’ well-being.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees with Pet Supplies Plus benefit from omnichannel shopping options, strong buying power, marketing support, and management and employee training. This franchise already has hundreds of successful locations across the country, with many growth markets still available.</p>

With the increasing demand for digital literacy and STEM education, iCode equips children and young adults with the knowledge and tools to thrive in the digital age.</p>
<br /><p>Their innovative curriculum, experienced instructors, and engaging learning environment foster creativity, problem-solving, and computational thinking. iCode’s franchise system includes dedicated training programs, ongoing support, and a protected area so that franchisees are set up for success.</p>

<br /><p>The post How to Cancel Republic Services (Read This First) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>Waste management companies are notorious for these unfair contracts, and Republic Services is no exception. There are many people out there trying to cancel Republic Services, only to be met with a complicated process or no response from their representatives. If this is you, keep reading to get a better understanding of the Republic Services cancellation process and figure out how to get the help you need.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services is a prominent waste management company that provides a comprehensive range of waste collection and disposal services. Claiming a commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship, Republic Services focuses on managing waste responsibly while offering efficient and reliable solutions. The company serves millions of residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal customers across the United States.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services offers various waste management services tailored to meet diverse needs. Their residential services encompass curbside waste collection, recycling programs, and yard waste removal. For businesses, Republic Services provides customized waste and recycling solutions, including commercial dumpster rentals, compactor services, and comprehensive waste management plans.</p>
<br /><p>Many people find themselves or their business in an undesirable contract with Republic Services. Often, these contracts have favorable terms for Republic Services, while the other party gets the short end of the stick.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re considering entering into an agreement with Republic Services, you should consider the following things:</p>
<br /><p>Additional fees popping up on your invoice are not unique to Republic Services. The entire waste management industry is known for having billing errors and overcharges on their invoices. Republic Services outlines the fees that may appear on their invoices in the contract for invoice-to-invoice agreements. These include:</p>
<br /><p>Not only should you expect your contract to include clauses for many different types of fees, but Republic Services is also known to include rate increases for services that may or may not be lawful. The waste management company has been on the receiving end of various lawsuits due to unlawful rate increases and fuel recovery fees, according to the website Republic Services Exposed. Knowing that Republic has already had issues with unlawful rate increases may cause business owners to seek Republic Services’ contract termination methods.</p>
<br /><p>The same website also reports that Republic Services has been forced to refund millions of dollars to their customers due to unauthorized fees and overcharges. Customers are responsible for finding these errors and invoices and submitting a claim for a refund. Most business owners don’t have time to dedicate to this process and therefore end up overspending on trash collection. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can help businesses immensely by handling invoice audits for them or helping them cancel Republic Services.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to employing questionable contract tactics, Republic Services lacks transparency and standard pricing. Some sales representatives prioritize commissions by encouraging customers to pay more for services, and business owners can’t trust that their representatives have their best interests at heart.</p>
<br /><p>If you go to the customer support portion of their website, the Republic Services Cancellation Policy looks pretty straightforward. Just give them a call and speak to your representative. In reality, many customers have a very hard time getting a hold of anyone to speak to at all.</p>
<br /><p>To guarantee the best success rate, we recommend working with a professional waste management auditor like P3 Cost Analysts, as there are numerous roadblocks not covered here Republic could put in your way. If you would like to go it alone, the following steps can serve as a guide for you.</p>
<br /><p>You should have read the fine print of your contract, like the terms and conditions, before signing. But if it’s been a while, or you didn’t pay close enough attention, you should go back to your contract before reaching out to your representative. Find out the specific cancellation requirements as outlined in your contract so you enter the conversation with all the necessary information and don’t experience any surprises.</p>
<br /><p>The next step is to call Republic Services. According to their website, you can find a phone number for your representative on the front of your invoice. Another option is to call their customer support line. Before calling, gather all the necessary account information to make the process smoother. Some customers may also have the option to cancel through the customer portal.</p>
<br /><p>It’s important to note that the Republic Services Cancellation Policy states that advance notice is required to cancel their services. Oftentimes it will not go into effect until 30 days after they receive cancellation.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re able to get a hold of your Republic Services representative or a customer support agent, clearly state that your intention is to cancel their services. Waste management companies often make it difficult for their customers to get out of the contract, so they may try to convince you to stay with them. It would be a good idea to document the time, date, and name of the representative you’re speaking with in case you run into problems down the line. It’s highly likely they will reference the contract or refer to the fact you are in an auto-renewal period at this time.</p>
<br /><p>If the representative you speak with gives you any further instructions on how to finish the Republic Services contract termination process, make sure you complete each step. This may include instructions on what to do with any equipment of theirs or official forms you need to fill out.</p>
<br /><p>There have been reports of people requesting cancellation but continuing to be charged by Republic Services. Request a confirmation of the cancellation in writing just in case they continue to charge you after your requested cancellation date. Be sure to check for future invoices and keep an eye out for any refunds you’re expecting.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re struggling with these steps on your own, save yourself the frustration. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts have decades of experience going up against giant waste-hauling companies like Republic Services. We can help you figure out how to cancel Republic Services, as well as help you find a better waste-hauling company and monitor future invoices for errors and overcharges from your next provider.</p>
<br /><p>With so many customers having issues with Republic Services and other heavy hitters such as Waste Management, some have started to look for smaller, more local waste-hauling companies that may provide a better customer experience. These organizations are also likely to be more flexible during contract negotiations.</p>
<br /><p>In many cases, Republic may be your best option. But in some cases you have choices. If you want Republic Services to stop service to your home or business, you’ll need to find another waste hauler to replace them.</p>
<br /><p>The first step is to cancel Republic Services; then you can begin shopping around for new providers. However, it’s important not to get locked into another predatory contract. P3 Cost Analysts can step in here to help you negotiate an agreement that serves you.</p>
<br /><p>There is no shortage of disappointed customers working with Republic Services, just like most of the other major waste-hauling providers. Unfortunately, these contracts are often written in favor of the supplier, leaving businesses and residences stuck with no way out.</p>
<br /><p>Republic Services makes it appear that the Republic Services Stop Service Process is straightforward and simple. Just follow the steps – look at your contract, contact your representative, and request a cancellation. Unfortunately, many people don’t have such a simple experience.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re looking for help at any stage of the waste management contract process, contact P3 Cost Analysts’ waste auditors. We will help you with the Republic Services cancellation process, as well as auditing your invoices, ensuring the cost-effectiveness of your contracts, and catching overcharges.</p>

<br /><p>The post Franchise Registration States: A Guide for Franchisees appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>To make things more clear, let’s explore the different types of franchise laws and highlight franchise registration states, franchise filing states, and franchise relationship states. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for both franchisors and prospective franchisees.</p>
<br /><p>As with all things business-related, federal and state governments have implemented a set of laws to control how franchises are registered, sold, and contracted. These legal requirements are in place to regulate the relationship between franchisors (the companies granting franchises) and franchisees (the individuals or entities purchasing and operating a franchise).</p>
<br /><p>The goal of these regulations is to provide a framework that promotes fairness, transparency, and protection for both parties. By establishing legal frameworks and guidelines, franchise laws provide a level of confidence and protection to prospective franchisees, encouraging entrepreneurship and promoting the growth of franchise businesses.</p>
<br /><p>In the United States, federal franchise laws primarily revolve around the regulation of franchise sales and disclosures. The key federal franchise law is the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) Franchise Rule, which sets forth requirements for franchisors to provide prospective franchisees with certain information before they enter into a franchise agreement.</p>
<br /><p>The Franchise Rule mandates that franchisors provide a Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to prospective franchisees at least 14 days before signing any agreement or making any payment. The FDD contains essential information about the franchisor, the franchise system, the franchise fee, ongoing costs, territory, trademarks, litigation history, and other relevant details.</p>
<br /><p>While federal franchise laws primarily focus on disclosure requirements and preventing fraudulent or deceptive practices, other federal laws — such as employment, intellectual property, and antitrust laws — may also apply to franchising.</p>
<br /><p>While federal franchise laws establish baseline requirements, state franchise laws often add additional provisions and requirements that franchisors and franchisees must adhere to. Franchisors must comply with the specific registration requirements in each state where they wish to offer franchises. Failure to do so can result in legal consequences, penalties, or even the inability to sell franchises in that state.</p>
<br /><p>Each state has its own set of franchise registration laws, and the requirements can vary. Some states have rigorous registration processes, while others have more lenient procedures. Below, we take a look at the difference between franchise registration states, franchise filing states, and franchise relationship states.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise registration states are U.S. states that require franchisors to register their franchise offering before selling franchises. These states have specific laws in place to protect prospective franchisees and ensure transparency. Franchisors must submit a comprehensive FDD that contains important information about the franchise opportunity. The FDD must be reviewed and approved by a state examiner who ensures that all state requirements have been filled.</p>
<br /><p>For potential franchisees, registration states offer several benefits and implications. First, franchisees are guaranteed access to comprehensive information about potential franchise opportunities. This enables potential franchisees to make informed decisions and thoroughly evaluate various franchises.</p>
<br /><p>The standardized and transparent disclosure process also ensures that franchisees have recourse and legal remedies if the franchisor fails to provide the required disclosures or engages in fraudulent or misleading practices.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise filing states also require that franchises file specific documents and pay a fee. However, the difference is that there is no approval process. These requirements, while not as strict as franchise registration states, aim to provide transparency and protect the interests of prospective franchisees by ensuring that franchisors meet certain standards and obligations before operating within the state.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise filing states offer some of the same benefits as registration states. However, since the filing requirements aren’t approved by the state, the level of protection isn’t the same. Still, franchise filing states offer increased transparency, regulatory oversight, state-specific protections, and enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<br /><p>If a state does not have franchise registration or franchise filing requirements, it is generally referred to as a non-registration state or a non-filing state. In these states, franchisors are not required to submit specific documents or disclosures to state authorities before offering or selling franchises. However, even in non-registration states, franchisors are still obligated to comply with federal franchise laws and stay in accordance with the Federal Franchise Rule.</p>
<br /><p>Despite the fact that these states still must follow federal regulations, there is limited state oversight in the franchising process. For franchisees, this enhances the importance of the due diligence process. Franchisees need to carefully review the FDD, seek legal advice, and conduct independent research to assess the viability and risks of the franchise opportunity. In addition, there may be fewer legal remedies in case of disputes with the franchisor or misrepresentation and unfair practices.</p>

<br /><p>Understanding franchise laws is crucial for both franchisors and prospective franchisees. Franchise registration states prioritize transparency and protection for franchisees by requiring franchisors to register their offerings and submit comprehensive disclosures. This ensures that potential franchisees have access to crucial information and legal remedies in case of fraudulent practices.</p>
<br /><p>While franchise filing states also aim to provide transparency and protection, in non-registration states, franchisees must rely on federal regulations and exercise due diligence to assess the likelihood of success and potential risks of the franchise opportunity. Regardless of which state you’re in, the P3 Cost Analysts franchise opportunity offers a low buy-in investment, comprehensive training, ongoing support, and all necessary software to help franchisees succeed in the cost reduction industry.</p>

<br /><p>The post What Is UPS SurePost? (+ How to Save On UPS Shipping) appeared first on P3 Cost Analysts.</p>
<br /><p>As businesses strive to meet the growing expectations of their customers, offering free shipping has emerged as a powerful strategy for boosting sales and enhancing customer satisfaction. However, for businesses to provide this enticing perk, they must navigate the complex realm of shipping logistics, where affordable shipping rates are key. UPS’s answer to this market need is its SurePost service.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a closer look at the specifics of UPS SurePost, including how it works, how long it takes, the specific benefits, and other ways to save money on shipping costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a service offered by the United Parcel Service (UPS) that combines the efficiency of UPS’s ground network with the final delivery handled by the United States Postal Service (USPS). It is designed to provide an economical and convenient shipping option for lightweight, non-urgent packages. It is commonly used for e-commerce shipments, allowing businesses that ship at least ten packages daily to offer affordable shipping options to their customers.</p>
<br /><p>The ideal SurePost package should be lightweight and compact enough to fit easily within a mail truck, weighing less than ten pounds and measuring under one cubic foot. Furthermore, the shipments should be destined for residential addresses, involve business-to-consumer transactions, possess a value below $100, and require only limited liability coverage. By meeting these requirements, shippers can leverage UPS SurePost to efficiently and affordably deliver their packages to customers.</p>
<br /><p>As mentioned above, UPS SurePost operates through a strategic collaboration between UPS and the USPS. The process begins when businesses enter into a contractual agreement for UPS SurePost services, which often involves parcel contract negotiation. Initially, UPS handles the transportation of the packages from the sender’s location to a designated UPS facility. At this point, UPS consolidates and sorts the packages before transferring them to the USPS for the final mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Once the packages are in the hands of the USPS, they are integrated into the existing USPS infrastructure for local delivery. USPS carriers transport the packages directly to their intended destinations, including residential addresses. Throughout the entire process, UPS provides robust tracking capabilities, allowing both businesses and customers to monitor the progress of their shipments and ensure transparency and peace of mind.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost packages are delivered by the United States Postal Service (USPS) as the last-mile carrier. The USPS is responsible for the final leg of the delivery process, bringing the packages directly to customers’ doorsteps. This delivery method is particularly well-suited for residential addresses and offers convenience for recipients who may not be available during regular business hours.</p>
<br /><p>While the average UPS SurePost delivery time may vary based on factors such as distance, location, and local USPS operations, they typically align with the USPS’s regular delivery schedule. It’s important to note that delivery to certain areas, such as rural or remote regions, may have specific limitations or longer transit times due to USPS service coverage.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, UPS SurePost deliveries generally follow the USPS delivery calendar, which typically excludes Sunday deliveries. However, UPS SurePost packages can still be in transit during weekends as they move through the UPS and USPS networks. It’s advisable to check with UPS or USPS for any specific delivery exceptions or holiday schedules that may impact SurePost deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost and UPS Ground are two residential ground services offered by UPS that allow businesses to decide between focusing on lowering shipping costs or enhancing customer experience. Both services have their advantages, with UPS Ground offering comprehensive coverage and flexibility, while UPS SurePost is more economical and utilizes the USPS network for efficient last-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>UPS Ground is delivered exclusively by UPS drivers, providing day-definite delivery typically within one to five business days. It offers multiple delivery attempts, a service guarantee, proof of delivery, and delivery of all package types. In addition, UPS Ground offers more value-added service options that aren’t available with SurePost, such as confirmation signatures, receiver management, and collect-on-delivery.</p>
<br /><p>On the other hand, UPS SurePost is best suited for small and lightweight packages and leverages the single-carrier network of UPS. With SurePost, businesses can deliver to PO boxes and all US territories.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to shipping with UPS SurePost, there are several advantages that businesses can capitalize on. From robust tracking capabilities to expedited delivery times, UPS SurePost offers benefits that can enhance the shipping experience for both businesses and their customers.</p>
<br /><p>UPS provides tracking capabilities for packages shipped with SurePost from start to finish. Businesses can monitor the progress of their shipments, ensuring transparency and peace of mind throughout the delivery process. Customers can also track their orders, offering them visibility and reassurance.</p>
<br /><p>UPS doesn’t stage packages for consolidation before sending them out for final-mile delivery with USPS. This means packages move through the network quickly, speeding up delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>One of the notable benefits of shipping with UPS SurePost is its commitment to environmental sustainability through carbon neutrality. UPS has taken significant steps to minimize its environmental impact and offers carbon-neutral shipping options for SurePost customers for $0.05 per package.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is offered to businesses using a direct-to-consumer business model as well. This means that online retailers can also reap the benefits of this affordable shipping option, with UPS collecting parcels directly from their warehouse.</p>
<br /><p>While UPS SurePost offers notable benefits, it’s important to consider potential limitations or drawbacks associated with this shipping service. By understanding these considerations, businesses can make informed decisions and determine if UPS SurePost aligns with their specific shipping requirements and objectives.</p>
<br /><p>UPS can only offer SurePost deliveries to addresses that USPS delivers to. While their network does cover most addresses in the country, there are some rural areas that are not included. In addition, offshore and military destinations may be subject to longer delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>For packages that cannot be delivered, if the shipper wants the package returned, they will incur postage fees from the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>When shipping with UPS SurePost, businesses benefit from limited liability coverage of up to $100. This coverage provides a degree of financial protection in the event of loss, damage, or theft during transit. However, this liability is only up until the point of transfer to the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>While choosing the right parcel delivery carrier and service offering is a huge step toward lowering shipping costs, there are other ways to save even more. If you’re looking to reduce shipping expenses and improve your bottom line, utilizing third-party companies like P3 Cost Analysts can make a significant difference. With our expertise in shipping contracts and invoicing audits, we can help save your business around 20 percent of your current delivery costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a contractual service, and carrier contracts can be complex and challenging to navigate, with different pricing tiers and fine print that can impact your costs. P3’s team of experts, comprised of former pricing analysts from major carriers, understands these intricacies and can provide insights to help you negotiate better deals.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to securing better rates, third-party companies like P3 can also conduct thorough parcel invoice audits to ensure you’re not missing out on refunds and credits. Billions of dollars in shipping refunds go unclaimed each year, and our auditing process can help you identify and recover any owed refunds, providing a valuable boost to your bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>What is the difference between UPS SurePost and UPS?</p>
<br /><p>UPS is a shipping carrier that offers many different shipping services for companies and individuals alike. SurePost is one of their offerings that utilizes the USPS for the final mile delivery to residential addresses, resulting in cost savings for businesses.</p>
<br /><p>Who is UPS SurePost delivered by?</p>
<br /><p>The idea behind SurePost is that UPS handles the initial transportation of the packages, and then they are handed over to the USPS for local delivery. Initially, most UPS SurePost parcels were handled by the USPS for the final leg of the delivery. However, UPS now performs around 40 percent of packages’ final-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>How does UPS SurePost tracking work?</p>
<br /><p>Customers can track a SurePost package throughout the entire shipping process. UPS’s robust tracking capabilities follow parcels all the way through the final mile using the same tracking number.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver on Sunday?</p>
<br /><p>SurePost’s guaranteed delivery days are from Monday through Saturday. However, in some locations where USPS offers Sunday deliveries and UPS has Saturday operations, packages may be delivered on Sunday as well.</p>
<br /><p>Is UPS SurePost safe?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost is generally considered safe for shipping packages. However, it’s important for businesses to ensure proper packaging to protect the contents during transportation. UPS provides guidelines and recommendations for packaging to ensure safe delivery. Still, with limited liability, high-value packages are best shipped through UPS Ground.</p>
<br /><p>How reliable is UPS SurePost?</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is known to be a reliable shipping service, offering consistent delivery times and a track record of successful package transportation. However, delivery times may vary depending on factors such as origin and destination locations, weather conditions, and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver to PO boxes?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost does deliver to PO boxes. The USPS is responsible for the final delivery of packages, and they have the capability to deliver to PO boxes as part of their standard mail services.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is an excellent low-cost shipping option for businesses. It combines UPS’s ground network with USPS for final delivery, making it an affordable solution for lightweight packages. SurePost offers advantages like tracking, quick package movement, and carbon-neutral shipping. However, it’s important to consider delivery limitations and limited liability coverage.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re ready to take control of your shipping costs and explore ways to save, consider partnering with a trusted third-party company like P3 Cost Analysts. We can help you negotiate the best conditions for your shipping contracts and audit ongoing invoices to ensure you’re not overpaying.</p>

<br /><p>One particular challenge in the shipping process is the last-mile delivery, which refers to the final leg of a package’s journey from a local distribution center to the customer’s address. Interestingly, this seemingly short distance can often be the most costly and complex part of package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx is one shipping company that has recently changed how they handle land-mile package deliveries. In 2021, the company began the rebranding from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy to keep up with the explosive growth of e-commerce and optimize its last-mile delivery process. Today, we’ll look at the former FedEx SmartPost, the shift to FedEx Ground Economy, and what that means for businesses like yours.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost was a hybrid shipping service that combined the resources of FedEx and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for package delivery. It was designed to provide a cost-effective solution for shipping lightweight packages to residential addresses by combining the speed and reliability of FedEx’s express network with the extensive reach of the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>When still operating, FedEx SmartPost utilized FedEx’s extensive express network for long-distance transportation and then handed off the packages to USPS for last-mile delivery. This collaboration allowed FedEx SmartPost to reach every U.S. residential address, including PO boxes and military residences, while offering competitive shipping rates for businesses. Despite the last mile being operated by USPS, shippers still had tracking capabilities and service available Monday to Saturday.</p>
<br /><p>The way FedEx SmartPost functioned allowed the shipping company to offer competitive shipping prices. However, the program was most useful for small, lightweight packages that weren’t time sensitive. Some shippers complained that the service was too slow or unreliable.</p>
<br /><p>The transition from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy was driven by several factors and the need to adapt to a changing market. Here are some of the likely reasons behind this decision:</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth of e-commerce has led to a significant increase in package volume being shipped to residential addresses. This surge in online shopping has placed greater demands on shipping services to handle higher volumes efficiently. FedEx recognized the need to optimize its operations to meet the growing demand and provide an improved customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost’s hybrid model of utilizing both FedEx’s express network and the USPS for final delivery presented some operational complexities. The transition to FedEx Ground Economy aimed to streamline operations by consolidating operations within FedEx’s own network and utilizing contracted drivers. This allows FedEx to have more control over the entire shipping process, resulting in improved efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>By focusing on ground transportation for the entire delivery process, FedEx can optimize routes, utilize its own delivery fleet more effectively, and potentially reduce costs associated with third-party partnerships.</p>
<br /><p>Overall, the transition from FedEx SmartPost to Ground Economy was driven by the need to adapt to the changing landscape of e-commerce, optimize operational efficiency, reduce costs, and provide an improved shipping experience for customers. By streamlining operations and focusing on ground transportation, FedEx aimed to meet the evolving demands of the market while ensuring efficient and reliable package delivery.</p>
<br /><p>While FedEx SmartPost relied on FedEx’s express network and USPS for last-mile delivery, FedEx Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network, providing more control over the entire delivery process. FedEx Ground drivers, or sometimes contracted third-party drivers, complete the last-mile delivery, bringing packages directly to recipients’ addresses.</p>
<br /><p>These changes are an effort by FedEx to ensure greater reliability and faster transit times compared to SmartPost. One major change from SmartPost to Ground Economy is the addition of Sunday deliveries. Ground Economy is a strong contender for businesses looking for outbound deliveries that are low-weight and non-urgent. Still, the following options are not available for Ground Economy:</p>
<br /><p>The shift from FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy began in 2019 as the company began delivering most SmartPost packages through their networks. The official rebrand happened in 2021 when they publicly introduced FedEx Ground Economy. The slow transition and similar product offerings meant that the two programs have many similarities; however, there are some key differences as well.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost utilized a hybrid model, combining FedEx’s express network for long-distance transportation and the USPS for last-mile delivery. Packages were handed off from FedEx to the USPS for final delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy operates solely within FedEx’s own network. It relies on ground transportation methods, such as trucks, for the entire delivery process, without involving the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>FedEx SmartPost shipping time was generally longer when compared to other FedEx services due to the involvement of the USPS for the last mile. Estimated FedEx SmartPost shipping time ranged from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination, and there were no Sunday deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>Estimated delivery times for Ground Economy are similar to that of SmartPost. Deliveries range from two to seven business days, depending on the distance and destination. However, FedEx now delivers Monday through Sunday, allowing them to shorten the average delivery time.</p>
<br /><p>SmartPost Returns followed a similar process to outbound delivery. To offer returns for their customers, businesses would include a prepaid shipping label along with the shipment. Then, the customer could leave the box in their mailbox, give it to their USPS carrier, or drop it off at a FedEx office.</p>
<br /><p>Ground Economy returns functions nearly the same as FedEx SmartPost Returns. However, customers now have even more options, with the ability to print a shipping label from a QR code or create one online.</p>
<br /><p>Tracking was available for packages delivered through SmartPost, even once the package was handed off to USPS. The 20-digital FedEx tracking number was converted to a USPS tracking number once the handoff was processed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that Ground Economy handles delivery for the entire process, only the FedEx tracking number is needed.</p>
<br /><p>Now that we understand the similarities and differences between FedEx Ground Economy and FedEx SmartPost, we can compare them with another popular delivery option, FedEx Home Delivery. First off, Home Delivery accepts packages up to 150 pounds, while Ground Economy has a maximum of 70 pounds. In addition, Home Delivery is a bit faster, with deliveries made between one and five business days.</p>
<br /><p>However, perhaps one of the largest differences between the two programs is the contractual agreement. Ground Economy is a contract service, meaning businesses must sign an agreement with FedEx outlining the terms and conditions of the contract. Meanwhile, Home Delivery is not a contract service.</p>
<br /><p>The rebranding of FedEx SmartPost to FedEx Ground Economy brings significant implications for shippers. Parcel management, with its inherent complexities and risks, requires careful attention to avoid unnecessary costs. By eliminating the handoff to USPS and taking responsibility for final mile delivery in-house, FedEx aims to streamline the process and enhance efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>However, this shift still necessitates FedEx contract negotiation and thorough FedEx invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and maximize return on investment. Companies must be vigilant in monitoring any invoice errors or unjust surcharges on their bills each month.</p>
<br /><p>The importance of analytics and shipment auditing cannot be overstated in today’s shipping industry. To address these challenges and optimize small parcel shipping costs, partnering with a cost reduction firm is your best choice. Companies like P3 Cost Analysts can provide invaluable expertise and solutions. By leveraging comprehensive analytics and auditing capabilities, we help shippers make informed decisions, uncover savings opportunities, and enhance their overall shipping strategies.</p>
<br /><p>The exponential growth of e-commerce and the need for operational efficiency and cost optimization have prompted FedEx to streamline its operations and bring the entire delivery process in-house. By eliminating the transfer to USPS and relying solely on its own network, FedEx aims to enhance reliability, shorten transit times, and provide a better shipping experience for customers.</p>
<br /><p>While the transition from SmartPost to Ground Economy offers several benefits, one thing remains constant regardless of which parcel delivery service business owners choose. Shippers must carefully review their contracts with FedEx, negotiate favorable terms, and conduct thorough invoice auditing to ensure accurate rates and avoid unnecessary costs.</p>
<br /><p>Partnering with a cost reduction firm like P3 Cost Analysts can provide valuable expertise and solutions in navigating the complexities of small parcel shipping. We will help you get control over your shipping expenses and make sure the delivery companies are working for you.</p>

<br /><p>In the world of business, cost management is a perpetual challenge. Companies across various industries are contending with increasing MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Operations) expenses, which can significantly impact their financial well-being.</p>
<br /><p>If not carefully managed, MRO spending can become a financial burden for organizations of all types and sizes. However, where there are expenses, there’s also an opportunity for cost-saving measures to improve the bottom line. In this blog, we’ll look into the world of MRO procurement, uncovering the vital role it plays in businesses and how effectively managing it can be the key to financial stability and growth.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing, also known as MRO procurement, is the process of acquiring goods and services necessary for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of a business. MRO, which stands for Maintenance, Repair, and Operations, is a vital component of indirect procurement, which deals with non-production-related expenses. These purchases cover a broad spectrum of items essential to keep a company’s operations running smoothly.</p>
<br /><p>In certain industries, such as healthcare, there’s a greater emphasis on indirect procurement, including MRO purchasing, versus direct procurement. This emphasis stems from the fact that these service-based industries heavily rely on the continuous functionality of equipment and facilities. In contrast, manufacturing industries may place more emphasis on direct procurement, focusing on sourcing materials directly related to their production processes.</p>
<br /><p>MRO purchasing encompasses a wide variety of procurement needs that are essential to the smooth and uninterrupted operation of a company. These MRO purchases can be conveniently categorized into three primary groups, each serving a distinct role in ensuring the seamless operation of a company:</p>
<br /><p>This category of MRO purchases primarily focuses on items necessary for the routine upkeep and maintenance of machinery, equipment, and facilities. It includes a range of components and supplies, such as:</p>
<br /><p>The repairs category of MRO purchases encompasses items and resources required for addressing unexpected breakdowns or malfunctions in machinery and equipment. It includes:</p>
<br /><p>The final category of MRO purchases — operations — covers services and supplies essential for the daily functioning of a business. This category includes items such as:</p>
<br /><p>Companies often face a series of challenges in the MRO procurement process, each with the potential to impact their bottom line and overall operational efficiency significantly.</p>
<br /><p>In many organizations, MRO procurement tends to be decentralized, with different departments or locations independently managing their needs. This separation can lead to inefficiencies as it often results in duplicate orders, missed opportunities for bulk purchasing discounts, and a lack of visibility into overall spending. Consequently, businesses may experience increased costs that could have been avoided with a more centralized and streamlined procurement approach.</p>
<br /><p>The complexity of managing a wide range of MRO suppliers is a common issue. Sourcing various parts, equipment, and services from multiple suppliers can become time-consuming and overwhelming. Furthermore, dealing with numerous suppliers can lead to inconsistent service levels, making it challenging to maintain reliable and efficient supply chains.</p>
<br /><p>Effective inventory control in MRO procurement is an ongoing struggle for many companies. Finding the right balance between maintaining adequate stock levels to ensure operational continuity and minimizing carrying costs is a constant challenge. Overstocked inventories tie up capital and storage space, while understocked inventories can lead to costly production disruptions. Striking this balance requires careful planning, forecasting, and demand management.</p>
<br /><p>Some MRO components are highly specialized and only needed at specific times. Managing the procurement of such specialized items can be challenging, as it requires predicting when and where these components will be required. Failing to anticipate these needs accurately can result in delays, increased downtime, and higher costs.</p>
<br /><p>To effectively manage MRO spend, businesses employ a range of strategic approaches tailored to their unique needs and challenges:</p>
<br /><p>The implementation of advanced procurement software and tools is essential in MRO strategy. These technological solutions offer enhanced visibility into procurement processes, allowing businesses to track orders, monitor inventory levels, and identify cost-saving opportunities. By leveraging technology, companies gain greater control over their MRO spend, reduce manual administrative tasks, and enhance overall efficiency.</p>
<br /><p>Many companies find value in streamlining their supplier base when it comes to MRO procurement. By reducing the number of MRO suppliers, organizations simplify supplier management, negotiation processes, and administrative tasks. This consolidation not only enhances efficiency but can also lead to better pricing agreements through increased purchasing volume.</p>
<br /><p>Leveraging data analytics has become a critical aspect of modern MRO strategy. By harnessing the power of data, businesses can make informed procurement decisions, optimize inventory levels, and anticipate future needs more accurately. Data-driven insights enable proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and mitigating the risk of emergency procurements that can be costly. Additionally, data analytics help identify trends, anomalies, and areas for cost savings within the MRO procurement process.</p>
<br /><p>One of the most effective approaches to MRO strategy is centralizing procurement. By consolidating the responsibility for MRO purchasing, companies can achieve greater consistency, better coordination, and improved cost control. Centralization fosters better alignment between departments, ensuring that MRO purchases meet the specific needs of each function. This collaborative approach enhances communication, streamlines decision-making, and ultimately results in more effective and cost-conscious procurement practices.</p>
<br /><p>These strategies collectively empower businesses to take a proactive approach to managing their MRO spend, enhancing efficiency, reducing costs, and ensuring the seamless operation of their facilities and equipment.</p>

<br /><p>Last mile delivery, the crucial link between businesses and customers, plays a vital role in customer satisfaction and the success of e-commerce and retail operations. The last mile delivery industry is evolving rapidly as the demand for faster, cheaper, and more convenient delivery options grows.</p>
<br /><p>This article will explore the top last mile delivery companies and startups this year, shedding light on established industry leaders and emerging disruptors. Whether you’re looking for reliable global logistics giants or innovative local players, this comprehensive guide will help you navigate the ever-changing landscape of last mile logistics.</p>
<br /><p>Last mile delivery is the final stage and arguably the most important part of the logistics process. This leg of the delivery process refers to when goods are transported from a distribution or fulfillment center to the customer’s doorstep. It is the crucial link between businesses and consumers. Last mile delivery plays a significant role in customer satisfaction and the overall success of e-commerce and retail operations.</p>
<br /><p>The process from customer purchase to last mile delivery looks something like this. First, a customer places an order, usually through an online retailer. The company then processes, packs, and prepares the item for shipment from its fulfillment center. At this point, the delivery vehicle will collect the product. Last mile delivery may be handled by the company themselves, such as with Amazon, or via a third party. Either way, the shipper is responsible for optimizing delivery routes for efficiency. Once the package has been delivered, the driver marks the order as complete.</p>
<br /><p>In recent years, the growth of e-commerce has led to an increased emphasis on last mile delivery services. Customers now expect faster, more convenient, and more flexible delivery options. E-commerce giants like Amazon have placed pressure on smaller companies to keep up with these advancements.</p>
<br /><p>While Amazon handles its own shipping needs, other businesses often rely on third-party last mile delivery companies to ship their products. These providers have responded to growing industry pressure by adopting innovative technologies – such as route optimization software, tracking systems, and delivery drones or robots – to streamline their last mile operations. In addition to the major players, we are now seeing startup companies looking to disrupt the industry, as well as software to help businesses optimize their shipping processes.</p>
<br /><p>Industry trends in last mile logistics mirror those of many other industries. As technology advances, people prioritize sustainability, and the demands of consumers evolve, each sector must adapt.</p>
<br /><p>Each year, the technological advancements in the industry continue to surprise us. One trend that is taking the industry by storm is robotics and automation. Self-driving delivery vehicles, drones, and other autonomous vehicles can not only lower costs and improve delivery times but also improve traffic issues. Additional technological advancements include AI route optimization, real-time communication tools, and GPS tracking systems.</p>
<br /><p>Sustainability has become a key focus in the last mile delivery sector. With increasing environmental concerns and pressure from the masses, companies are adopting more sustainable practices to reduce carbon emissions. This includes the use of electric vehicles and alternative fuel sources, as well as optimizing delivery routes to minimize fuel consumption. Some companies are also exploring more localized fulfillment operations, utilizing eco-friendly packaging materials, and implementing recycling programs to reduce waste.</p>
<br /><p>Enhancing the customer experience is a top priority for last mile delivery providers. Real-time tracking systems allow customers to monitor the progress of their deliveries and receive accurate estimated arrival times. Delivery notifications through SMS or mobile apps enable customers to plan their schedules accordingly. Moreover, personalized delivery options, such as choosing delivery time windows or designated safe drop-off locations, contribute to a more convenient and satisfying customer experience.</p>
<br /><p>The demand for faster deliveries, including same-day and on-demand services, has grown significantly. Last mile delivery providers are adapting to this trend by offering expedited delivery options. Some companies have developed networks of local couriers or crowd-sourced drivers to fulfill immediate delivery requests. Additionally, partnerships with brick-and-mortar stores or lockers enable customers to pick up or return orders at convenient locations.</p>
<br /><p>These well-established industry leaders have built a strong reputation and extensive networks in the last mile delivery space. With their focus on optimization, reliability, and innovative solutions, they have set the benchmark for efficient and effective delivery services.</p>

Referred to as “the Amazon Effect,” it has reshaped customer expectations and accelerated delivery times. Each year, Amazon continues enhancing its delivery options, striving for ever-increasing speed and efficiency. Its expansive logistics network and focus on fast, reliable shipping have made Amazon a driving force in the industry.</p>

<br /><p>Recessions are a natural part of the economic cycle, coming and going like the tides. Despite the inevitable economic challenges, entrepreneurs pour their time, energy, and resources into starting their companies, hoping for success even during times of economic uncertainty.</p>
<br /><p>Savvy entrepreneurs understand that waiting for the “perfect” moment to start a business is futile. A better tactic is to opt for a company that can withstand the test of time and economic downturns by choosing recession-proof industries.</p>
<br /><p>In this blog, we’ll explore ten recession-proof business ideas that can offer the potential for lasting success and stability, regardless of the economic climate. Let’s dive into these opportunities and discover how specific businesses that do well in a recession can provide peace of mind for entrepreneurs in both prosperous and challenging times.</p>
<br /><p>A recession-proof business is one that is not as heavily impacted by the economic effects of a recession, typically stemming from industries that provide basic needs. Because they offer needed products and services, they are the last industries to be affected by changes in consumer spending.</p>
<br /><p>To be clear, there is no such thing as a fully recession-proof business. Every recession is completely different and impossible to predict. For example, the real estate market crashed in 2008 but actually thrived during the early 2000s recession. However, some recession-proof industries are much more likely to weather the storm, regardless of what causes the economy to falter.</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses are those found in sectors that thrive even during economic downturns, such as:</p>
<br /><p>Recession-proof businesses typically cater to non-negotiable needs, offering products or services that people cannot easily forgo. By providing essential solutions, these businesses ensure their relevance and demand even during economic downturns.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, sustaining affordable prices plays a crucial role in their resilience during challenging times. When consumers become more budget-conscious in recessions, businesses offering competitive pricing are generally better positioned to retain customers and maintain a steady revenue stream.</p>
<br /><p>Regardless of how the economy looks when you decide to start your own business, setting yourself up with a recession-proof business is a solid plan. You never know what the future holds, and these business ideas can give you some assurance now and for years to come.</p>
<br /><p>The automotive services industry includes all post-purchase services necessary to keep a car in working order, such as oil changes, tire repairs, air conditioning, electrical inspections, plus body repair, painting, and much more.</p>
<br /><p>The market is expected to register a 3 percent compound annual growth rate over the next five years and reach a value of $76.91 billion by 2027.</p>
<br /><p>If people aren’t out buying new cars, you can best believe they’re doing everything they can to take care of the ones they have. Cars inevitably need maintenance as they age and have more miles put on them, even during a recession. Plus, as long as the freight industry continues to remain strong, there will be a need for servicing big rigs and delivery trucks.</p>
<br /><p>Times have changed, and more and more families have two working parents, whether out of necessity or personal preference. Paid childcare services provide supervision, care, and sometimes education to infants and young children.</p>
<br /><p>Childcare services were valued at $54.3 billion in 2019 and will continue to grow. From 2020 to 2027, there is an expected compound annual growth rate of 3.9 percent.</p>
<br /><p>During a recession, parents may have to work longer hours or even more than one job. While historically expensive, childcare services are still one of the last costs parents abandon. Not to mention they usually make up a significant part of their budget. It’s not just about a safe place to leave your child while you’re at work. For many, it’s the first step of their growth and education.</p>
<br /><p>The real estate industry involves the sale of land, residential, commercial, and industrial properties. But, there are other businesses involving real estate that may also thrive during a recession, like property management or investment firms.</p>
<br /><p>Zillow Group expects that home value will continue to rise, going up 7.8 percent in the next 12 months.</p>
<br /><p>It might surprise you to see real estate on our list when you consider the Great Recession. However, historically speaking, a recession does not always mean the housing market will crash. As of right now, home prices continue to soar, but even if prices drop, it may be the perfect opportunity for investors.</p>
<br /><p>While prices fluctuate short term, the sector is usually more stable in the long run. Real estate even proved to be one of the most pandemic-proof businesses as the housing market boomed.</p>
<br /><p>Millions of businesses and firms seek outside help regarding accounting and other financial information services, as do individuals. With rules and regulations getting more complicated and confusing, consulting experts seems to be the go-to move. Services offered include tax preparation, bookkeeping, and invoice outsourcing.</p>
<br /><p>Worldwide, the financial services market grew from $2.5 trillion to $3.3 trillion between 2010 and 2018.</p>
<br /><p>Even if the economy slows down, it never comes to a full halt. In fact, financial services drive the economy. So, many financial and accounting services continue to do well during hard times.</p>
<br /><p>Home improvement services encompass a wide range of offerings aimed at enhancing and maintaining residential properties. These services can include renovations, remodeling, repairs, and upgrades to various areas of a home, such as kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, roofing, and more. Whether homeowners want to increase their property’s value, create a more comfortable living space, or address necessary repairs, the home improvement industry caters to their diverse needs.</p>
<br /><p>The home improvement industry accounted for $538 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach more than $620 billion by 2025.</p>
<br /><p>Certain services this industry provides, such as HVAC repair, electric, and home repair, are necessary even during a recession. AC units don’t care about the economic situation, but many Americans live in areas where you simply cannot live without it. Damaged roofs, leaking pipes, and other issues will still need to be repaired immediately. Home improvement also turned out to be a covid-proof business. With people stuck at home, many decided to fix up their houses.</p>
<br /><p>Americans sure do love their pets. The animal care industry is massive and covers many different categories, including medical care, toys, daycare, and more. As people become more educated on animals’ needs and welfare, they are highly aware of where they put their money when it comes to their pets.</p>
<br /><p>The global pet care market is expected to grow to more than 325 billion by 2028, with dog products and services pulling in the highest revenues.</p>
<br /><p>If you believe everything you read on the internet, millennials have canceled having children and are having pets instead. Especially after the pandemic, the pet industry is breaking records, and proper pet care is not something most people are willing to forgo when money gets tight.</p>
<br /><p>Business consulting includes a broad range of professional services other companies need help with, such as strategy, market research, or public relations. Consultants or consulting firms are meant to help their clients by solving specific problems or issues, often saving them money.</p>
<br /><p>From freelancers to large firms, consulting businesses are generating up to $300 billion in annual revenues.</p>
<br /><p>Consulting businesses can stay afloat during recessions because of their ability to be flexible and adapt to market situations. If companies are struggling to make money and you can help them create growth or optimize during a recession, they will want to keep you around. Plus, staying profitable will be much easier with no inventory and little overhead.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS market has grown at insane speeds over the past ten years and isn’t likely to slow down. Software as a service is delivered via the internet rather than installing complicated software and hardware. As a cloud-based service, the ease, scalability, and security are high, and users typically pay a monthly or yearly fee.</p>
<br /><p>The rapid growth is expected to continue, with the market estimated to be worth about $208 billion in 2023, with US companies leading the way.</p>
<br /><p>The SaaS industry is another with little to no overhead, making them easier for businesses to maintain during a recession. In addition, many of these software are fully integrated into business processes, so companies can’t afford to ditch them during a recession.</p>
<br /><p>The healthcare industry includes a wide range of services, from hospitals and medical clinics to pharmaceutical companies and medical equipment manufacturers. The healthcare sector is dedicated to promoting, maintaining, and restoring human health through medical and therapeutic interventions.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, the healthcare market is expected to reach nearly $59 billion in 2023 and show an annual growth rate of 10.4 percent in the years to come.</p>
<br /><p>Healthcare is a fundamental need that people cannot do without, regardless of the economic situation. During a recession, individuals may cut back on unnecessary spending, but they will continue to seek medical care when necessary. Moreover, the recent global pandemic has highlighted the significance of pandemic-proof businesses in the healthcare industry. The ability to provide essential medical services, telehealth consultations, and innovative solutions while adapting to rapidly changing circumstances has highlighted the industry’s resilience.</p>
<br /><p>According to Statista, in 2020, about 16.9 percent of the United States population was 65 or older. By 2030, that percentage is projected to reach 20.6 percent. This demographic shift emphasizes the demand for senior services for this growing population segment.</p>
<br /><p>Senior services may include a range of businesses that cater to the needs of the elderly population. As people age, they may require assistance with daily activities, healthcare, companionship, and other specialized services to maintain a high quality of life.</p>
<br /><p>The aging population’s continuous growth has led to an increased need for senior services, making this one of the most recession-proof industries. For many elderly individuals, these services are crucial for their well-being and safety, ensuring their relevance even during economic downturns. Additionally, the expansion of retirement communities and assisted living facilities opens up further opportunities for entrepreneurs in this field.</p>
<br /><p>Starting an entire business from scratch can be costly, take a while to get things moving, and have no guarantee of success after all your hard work and dedication. A recession-proof franchise can take a lot of the guesswork out of the equation and help you get your business up and running much faster.</p>
<br /><p>Franchising offers a proven business model with established brand recognition, training, and ongoing support from the franchisor. By investing in a recession-proof franchise, such as one with P3 Cost Analysts, you can leverage the expertise and experience of a well-established brand, increasing your chances of success even during challenging economic times. Additionally, as part of a larger network, you can benefit from collective buying power, marketing resources, and shared knowledge.</p>
<br /><p>In uncertain economic times, having a recession-proof business can provide stability and security. The listed recession-proof business ideas cover various industries, from automotive services and child care to real estate and healthcare. By identifying essential products that people will continue to seek even during a recession, you can position your business for long-term success.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re looking for an opportunity for business ownership in a sector that will thrive during all economic conditions, a cost reduction consulting franchise with P3 Cost Analysts could be the right move. If you have a passion for helping other business owners and want to help them cut costs during a recession, then you would shine with a cost reduction consulting franchise.</p>

<br /><p>In the ever-evolving world of e-commerce, one thing remains constant – buyers love free shipping. The allure of clicking that “checkout” button without the burden of additional shipping costs has become an essential factor in the online shopping experience.</p>
<br /><p>As businesses strive to meet the growing expectations of their customers, offering free shipping has emerged as a powerful strategy for boosting sales and enhancing customer satisfaction. However, for businesses to provide this enticing perk, they must navigate the complex realm of shipping logistics, where affordable shipping rates are key. UPS’s answer to this market need is its SurePost service.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a closer look at the specifics of UPS SurePost, including how it works, how long it takes, the specific benefits, and other ways to save money on shipping costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a service offered by the United Parcel Service (UPS) that combines the efficiency of UPS’s ground network with the final delivery handled by the United States Postal Service (USPS). It is designed to provide an economical and convenient shipping option for lightweight, non-urgent packages. It is commonly used for e-commerce shipments, allowing businesses that ship at least ten packages daily to offer affordable shipping options to their customers.</p>
<br /><p>The ideal SurePost package should be lightweight and compact enough to fit easily within a mail truck, weighing less than ten pounds and measuring under one cubic foot. Furthermore, the shipments should be destined for residential addresses, involve business-to-consumer transactions, possess a value below $100, and require only limited liability coverage. By meeting these requirements, shippers can leverage UPS SurePost to efficiently and affordably deliver their packages to customers.</p>
<br /><p>As mentioned above, UPS SurePost operates through a strategic collaboration between UPS and the USPS. The process begins when businesses enter into a contractual agreement for UPS SurePost services, which often involves parcel contract negotiation. Initially, UPS handles the transportation of the packages from the sender’s location to a designated UPS facility. At this point, UPS consolidates and sorts the packages before transferring them to the USPS for the final mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>Once the packages are in the hands of the USPS, they are integrated into the existing USPS infrastructure for local delivery. USPS carriers transport the packages directly to their intended destinations, including residential addresses. Throughout the entire process, UPS provides robust tracking capabilities, allowing both businesses and customers to monitor the progress of their shipments and ensure transparency and peace of mind.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost packages are delivered by the United States Postal Service (USPS) as the last-mile carrier. The USPS is responsible for the final leg of the delivery process, bringing the packages directly to customers’ doorsteps. This delivery method is particularly well-suited for residential addresses and offers convenience for recipients who may not be available during regular business hours.</p>
<br /><p>While the average UPS SurePost delivery time may vary based on factors such as distance, location, and local USPS operations, they typically align with the USPS’s regular delivery schedule. It’s important to note that delivery to certain areas, such as rural or remote regions, may have specific limitations or longer transit times due to USPS service coverage.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, UPS SurePost deliveries generally follow the USPS delivery calendar, which typically excludes Sunday deliveries. However, UPS SurePost packages can still be in transit during weekends as they move through the UPS and USPS networks. It’s advisable to check with UPS or USPS for any specific delivery exceptions or holiday schedules that may impact SurePost deliveries.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost and UPS Ground are two residential ground services offered by UPS that allow businesses to decide between focusing on lowering shipping costs or enhancing customer experience. Both services have their advantages, with UPS Ground offering comprehensive coverage and flexibility, while UPS SurePost is more economical and utilizes the USPS network for efficient last-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>UPS Ground is delivered exclusively by UPS drivers, providing day-definite delivery typically within one to five business days. It offers multiple delivery attempts, a service guarantee, proof of delivery, and delivery of all package types. In addition, UPS Ground offers more value-added service options that aren’t available with SurePost, such as confirmation signatures, receiver management, and collect-on-delivery.</p>
<br /><p>On the other hand, UPS SurePost is best suited for small and lightweight packages and leverages the single-carrier network of UPS. With SurePost, businesses can deliver to PO boxes and all US territories.</p>
<br /><p>When it comes to shipping with UPS SurePost, there are several advantages that businesses can capitalize on. From robust tracking capabilities to expedited delivery times, UPS SurePost offers benefits that can enhance the shipping experience for both businesses and their customers.</p>
<br /><p>UPS provides tracking capabilities for packages shipped with SurePost from start to finish. Businesses can monitor the progress of their shipments, ensuring transparency and peace of mind throughout the delivery process. Customers can also track their orders, offering them visibility and reassurance.</p>
<br /><p>UPS doesn’t stage packages for consolidation before sending them out for final-mile delivery with USPS. This means packages move through the network quickly, speeding up delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>One of the notable benefits of shipping with UPS SurePost is its commitment to environmental sustainability through carbon neutrality. UPS has taken significant steps to minimize its environmental impact and offers carbon-neutral shipping options for SurePost customers for $0.05 per package.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is offered to businesses using a direct-to-consumer business model as well. This means that online retailers can also reap the benefits of this affordable shipping option, with UPS collecting parcels directly from their warehouse.</p>
<br /><p>While UPS SurePost offers notable benefits, it’s important to consider potential limitations or drawbacks associated with this shipping service. By understanding these considerations, businesses can make informed decisions and determine if UPS SurePost aligns with their specific shipping requirements and objectives.</p>
<br /><p>UPS can only offer SurePost deliveries to addresses that USPS delivers to. While their network does cover most addresses in the country, there are some rural areas that are not included. In addition, offshore and military destinations may be subject to longer delivery times.</p>
<br /><p>For packages that cannot be delivered, if the shipper wants the package returned, they will incur postage fees from the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>When shipping with UPS SurePost, businesses benefit from limited liability coverage of up to $100. This coverage provides a degree of financial protection in the event of loss, damage, or theft during transit. However, this liability is only up until the point of transfer to the USPS.</p>
<br /><p>While choosing the right parcel delivery carrier and service offering is a huge step toward lowering shipping costs, there are other ways to save even more. If you’re looking to reduce shipping expenses and improve your bottom line, utilizing third-party companies like P3 Cost Analysts can make a significant difference. With our expertise in shipping contracts and invoicing audits, we can help save your business around 20 percent of your current delivery costs.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is a contractual service, and carrier contracts can be complex and challenging to navigate, with different pricing tiers and fine print that can impact your costs. P3’s team of experts, comprised of former pricing analysts from major carriers, understands these intricacies and can provide insights to help you negotiate better deals.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to securing better rates, third-party companies like P3 can also conduct thorough parcel invoice audits to ensure you’re not missing out on refunds and credits. Billions of dollars in shipping refunds go unclaimed each year, and our auditing process can help you identify and recover any owed refunds, providing a valuable boost to your bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>What is the difference between UPS SurePost and UPS?</p>
<br /><p>UPS is a shipping carrier that offers many different shipping services for companies and individuals alike. SurePost is one of their offerings that utilizes the USPS for the final mile delivery to residential addresses, resulting in cost savings for businesses.</p>
<br /><p>Who is UPS SurePost delivered by?</p>
<br /><p>The idea behind SurePost is that UPS handles the initial transportation of the packages, and then they are handed over to the USPS for local delivery. Initially, most UPS SurePost parcels were handled by the USPS for the final leg of the delivery. However, UPS now performs around 40 percent of packages’ final-mile delivery.</p>
<br /><p>How does UPS SurePost tracking work?</p>
<br /><p>Customers can track a SurePost package throughout the entire shipping process. UPS’s robust tracking capabilities follow parcels all the way through the final mile using the same tracking number.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver on Sunday?</p>
<br /><p>SurePost’s guaranteed delivery days are from Monday through Saturday. However, in some locations where USPS offers Sunday deliveries and UPS has Saturday operations, packages may be delivered on Sunday as well.</p>
<br /><p>Is UPS SurePost safe?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost is generally considered safe for shipping packages. However, it’s important for businesses to ensure proper packaging to protect the contents during transportation. UPS provides guidelines and recommendations for packaging to ensure safe delivery. Still, with limited liability, high-value packages are best shipped through UPS Ground.</p>
<br /><p>How reliable is UPS SurePost?</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is known to be a reliable shipping service, offering consistent delivery times and a track record of successful package transportation. However, delivery times may vary depending on factors such as origin and destination locations, weather conditions, and unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<br /><p>Does UPS SurePost deliver to PO boxes?</p>
<br /><p>Yes, UPS SurePost does deliver to PO boxes. The USPS is responsible for the final delivery of packages, and they have the capability to deliver to PO boxes as part of their standard mail services.</p>
<br /><p>UPS SurePost is an excellent low-cost shipping option for businesses. It combines UPS’s ground network with USPS for final delivery, making it an affordable solution for lightweight packages. SurePost offers advantages like tracking, quick package movement, and carbon-neutral shipping. However, it’s important to consider delivery limitations and limited liability coverage.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re ready to take control of your shipping costs and explore ways to save, consider partnering with a trusted third-party company like P3 Cost Analysts.

<br /><p>In today’s digital era, it might be surprising to learn that the print industry remains essential. Key sectors like education, legal, healthcare, and government continue their heavy reliance on printed materials. Businesses in these sectors typically work with managed print services, or MPS. The primary goal of MPS is to improve efficiency, productivity, and security.</p>
<br /><p>Hewlett Packard (HP) is a major player in the printing domain. They’ve built a reputation for delivering quality products over the years and are a go-to for many in managed printing services. However, it’s worth noting that size and reputation don’t always translate to the best fit for every business’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Today, we will take a closer look at HP’s managed print services, their top competitors, and how your business can save money on printing.</p>
<br /><p>While HP is known for its wide array of products and services, there’s no shortage of competitors that offer very similar features. While MPS aims to save businesses money on printing, some major issues in the industry plague their effectiveness.</p>
<br /><p>Whether you’re working with HP or one of its competitors, you’re likely to run into one of the following issues:</p>
<br /><p>Many clients face billing discrepancies and lack transparency in the charges levied by major print and copier providers. The overcharges and hidden costs can lead to businesses paying more than they should.</p>
<br /><p>The standard terms and conditions in MPS contracts often favor the vendor, exposing the client to potential pitfalls. These unfavorable conditions highlight the importance of renegotiating terms to better protect the client’s interests.</p>
<br /><p>While businesses spend substantially on their print and copier services, they often don’t receive the promised service. Frequent equipment downtimes, poor support, and an overall lack of management can negatively affect a company’s operations.</p>
<br /><p>Many MPS programs are overly intricate, leading to wasted time and inefficiency for organizations. Clients are searching for programs that are not only cost-effective but also simple to understand and manage.</p>
<br /><p>With businesses spending millions on printing services annually, there’s a clear opportunity to find cost-saving solutions. While you may consider switching to one of the competitors on our list, there are other alternatives as well. For example, the quickest and most straightforward way to save money is by consulting with a company that specializes in auditing MPS invoices, such as P3 Cost Analysts.</p>

<br /><p>For those looking to start a lucrative business while having the freedom to work from home, starting an online franchise is a great option.</p>
<br /><p>Starting an online franchise not only brings more work-life balance, but it gives you the opportunity to run a business without many of the headaches that brick-and-mortar franchises often come with.</p>
<br /><p>In this article, we’ll explore the benefits of starting an online franchise and provide examples of some of the best online franchises you can start this year.</p>
<br /><p>Buying into an online franchise means diving into a world where convenience meets potential. But before looking at specific options, it’s essential to consider what major benefits of starting an online franchise draw in potential business owners. Let’s explore the advantages that come with starting an online franchise.</p>
<br /><p>Instead of being tied down to a physical location, starting an online franchise allows you to essentially work from anywhere that has an internet connection. This could be a home office, coffee shop, hotel room, or any other destination you wish to work from.</p>
<br /><p>Some franchises will require you to work in the field or meet up with clients from time to time, but you’ll have the flexibility to schedule these meetings on your own time.</p>
<br /><p>This freedom of designing your schedule can be quite liberating. Whether you are a parent, caretaker, or simply have other responsibilities outside of work, starting a home-based franchise will allow you to create a life that fits your needs.</p>
<br /><p>Most online franchises require minimal employees for you to manage, while others can be run completely by yourself. Some may allow you to start out as the only operator and, once you scale and get more comfortable with the business, it would make sense to bring on the employees that you need. In all cases though, online franchises typically have management training or systems to help you manage these employees effectively.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, most online franchises have little overhead in comparison with their non-online counterparts. When you think of how employee- and cost-intensive retail or food franchises are, it makes sense for most people to run an online business.</p>
<br /><p>For a lot of work-from-home franchises, the clientele you work with will be recurring and therefore allow you to bring in predictable income. Also, depending on the type of service you offer, it might not take a ton of clients to actually meet your profit goals. Franchises with recurring revenue are especially great for those that want to work part-time while still retaining clients month after month.</p>
<br /><p>With many online franchises, you’re able to pull clients from all across the country or even the world. This allows you to scale much bigger and quicker than if you were tied down to a physical space in your local community. Furthermore, since your online business can be open 24/7, people can reach out or purchase services even while you’re sleeping.</p>
<br /><p>Starting a cost reduction franchise with P3 Cost Analysts is a great opportunity to do rewarding work in a booming industry.

<br /><p>Many people are drawn to entrepreneurship, but the financial challenges of starting a business can be a significant deterrent. This is where the franchise model shines, offering a pathway to business ownership with a reduced risk factor.</p>

Instead of starting from scratch, franchises provide a proven business model, brand recognition, and an established customer base.

Investors are equipped with training, support, and a roadmap, greatly reducing the uncertainty and risk that can plague new, independent ventures.</p>
<br /><p>However, many of the well-known franchise opportunities come with a hefty price tag, making them inaccessible to a large portion of aspiring business owners.

<br /><p>The goal is obviously a low-cost franchise with high-profit returns, so to choose one you need to check off some boxes to ensure the franchise you decide on has the best possible chance of success.</p>
<br /><p>Make sure the franchisor has a proven support system for franchisees, specifically with regards to marketing because that is what will make or break your business.</p>
<br /><p>For example, does the franchisor advertise the brand? Do they make it easy for people to know about the business?</p>
<br /><p>The marketing and brand are what you are paying for most, so it is critical that they’ve mastered this particular aspect. The marketing they do for the brand as a whole is of the utmost importance, as well as the support they give to franchisees, otherwise, you are wasting your money by investing in a franchise business instead of starting up from scratch.</p>
<br /><p>It is important to know if there is a demand for the products or services they sell, and if products or services are offered in specific locations, is there a demand for them there?</p>
<br /><p>The product could be exceptional, but there is a possibility that if it’s in the wrong location, the business could flop. Request this information from the franchisor. Another good way of determining demand is by doing a simple Google Trends search to find out if people in the area are searching for those products.</p>
<br /><p>It’s also a good idea to analyze the competition for the product or service—that may give you a good idea of what it takes to be successful.</p>
<br /><p>Check nationwide the number of locations and annual revenue. It may also be a good idea to have some conversations with other franchisees.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Direct offers another valuable tip: the best way to determine a franchise’s future profitability is by analyzing Item 19 of the franchise’s FDD (franchise disclosure document), which outlines the business’s financial performance. It may be beneficial to consult an accountant or lawyer to fully understand this.</p>
<br /><p>Only consider the franchises whose initial fee and upfront investments are realistic for your current financial situation; this may be another discussion to have with an accountant or lawyer.</p>
<br /><p>There may be hidden costs, personal financial necessities, or royalties, so reading the fine print is essential.</p>
<br /><p>Lastly, but perhaps most importantly: Is what’s required of you something you will enjoy doing, and do you believe in the core offering? For most people, using their top skills is what’s going to fulfill them on a daily basis.</p>
<br /><p>Armed with this knowledge, there are several franchises that meet the above requirements and are also low-investment, high-return franchises.</p>
<br /><p>Every entrepreneur aims for a high return on investment (ROI) when stepping into the business world. While initiating a venture from scratch offers a certain allure, franchising often presents a more secure route to achieving that desired high ROI with lower startup costs. With the foundation of a proven system and established methodologies, a franchise can significantly amplify your potential returns.</p>
<br /><p>P3 Cost Analysts stands at the forefront of high-ROI franchise opportunities. Our specialty lies in a service that is always in demand: cost reduction. Our straightforward commitment to businesses is clear:</p>

<br /><p>Dr. Josh Funk is the Founder and CEO of Rehab 2 Perform, a physical therapy and personal training center that provides solutions to improve movement and increase physicality and performance. As a lifelong athlete, he became interested in becoming a physical therapist while going through PT treatments as a D1 lacrosse player at Ohio State. Dr. Funk earned a BS degree from The Ohio State University before earning his Doctor of Physical Therapy degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. </p>
<br /><p>After avoiding shoulder surgery for a torn labrum and rotator cuff, Dr. Funk has been entrenched in the world of physical therapy and sports performance. He has grown Rehab 2 Perform to eight locations and has been recognized twice as an Inc. 5000 entrepreneur. Dr. Funk is also the host of the High Performers Podcast. </p>
<br /><p>Are you a passionate expert in your industry? Do you have what it takes to start and grow a business? </p>
<br /><p>According to Dr. Josh Funk, there are three fundamental requirements of owning a successful business: social capital, financial capital, and intellectual capital. Social capital entails building a network of dedicated people to provide value for your company. With intellectual capital, it’s crucial to manage and promote your services in your designated marketplace. Business owners must also understand how to separate their personal and business finances. By implementing these standards, Dr. Funk has scaled his physical therapy business to multiple locations.</p>
<br /><p>On this episode of The Enterprise Builders Podcast, Scott Swearingen welcomes Dr. Josh Funk, Founder and CEO of Rehab 2 Perform, to discuss his journey of starting and running a successful physical therapy business. Dr. Funk shares how he became a physical therapist, the three C’s required to start and run a business, how he scaled his business and retained employees, and his key takeaways from participating in business programs.</p>

<br /><p>In today’s fast-paced business world, companies manage numerous invoices for essential services. With this quantity of transactions, there’s a significant chance of overcharges. Efficiently optimizing expenses can be the difference between steady growth and mere survival, but managing these costs alone can be overwhelming for business owners.</p>
<br /><p>Enter cost reduction firms, which have emerged as crucial allies for businesses. Among them, Schooley Mitchell is one option to consider. However, is Schooley Mitchell the right choice for every business? Not necessarily. Join us as we take a closer look at Schooley Mitchell, compare it with other alternatives, and help you make an informed decision for your company’s specific needs.</p>
<br /><p>Founded in 1998, Schooley Mitchell has established itself as an independent cost reduction consulting firm primarily rooted in the Canadian market. Over time, it has expanded its operations, working with numerous businesses across various sectors throughout North America.</p>
<br /><p>Schooley Mitchell’s primary focus lies in telecom, merchant services, and small package shipping. They also offer services in fuel, waste, compressed gasses, electronic logging, SaaS, and facility supplies. With over two decades in the industry, they’ve gained some recognition in the cost reduction consultancy field.</p>
<br /><p>Here are a few reasons why business owners might consider Schooley Mitchell competitors:</p>
<br /><p>In the competitive landscape of cost reduction, P3 Cost Analysts has emerged with an impressive array of services that focus on businesses’ core operational costs. Their expertise spans the usual utilities such as electricity, water, and gas. Additionally, they excel in telecom services, covering both phones and the internet. Further deepening its portfolio, P3 gets into niche domains such as waste recycling, merchant accounts, uniforms, linens, managed print, and property tax assessments. Their approach is not just about auditing but about understanding each expense’s intricacies, ensuring businesses save and optimize for the future.</p>
<br /><p>What truly sets P3 Cost Analysts apart is their transparency and verifiable results. They provide clear examples, backed by actual dollar amounts, showcasing the substantial savings they’ve secured for clients in the past. Moreover, their value proposition is enticingly straightforward: an impressive 20-40% average savings, a promise that if you don’t save, you don’t pay, and a shared savings approach that ensures zero risks to their clients.</p>
<br /><p>With such a robust offering and undeniable results, P3 Cost Analysts emerges as a top contender among Schooley Mitchell competitors. In addition, P3 is the only U.S.-based cost reduction consulting company to offer franchising, with 41 successful franchisees in 25 states and growing.</p>
<br /><p>Navigating the industry of cost reduction, Expense Reduction Analysts (ERA) offer a range of services targeting businesses’ primary financial drains. Their focus includes sectors such as automotive, communications, technology, utilities, construction, engineering, educational services, and more, stretching to areas like hospitality, manufacturing, retail, and transport.</p>
<br /><p>One thing that distinguishes this Schooley Mitchell competitor is their global perspective, thanks to their widespread presence in over 40 countries. They advocate for strategic sourcing and improved profitability, and while their offerings are commendable, it’s always wise for businesses to thoroughly evaluate the alignment of ERA’s services with their unique needs.</p>
<br /><p>Born in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, SIB has showcased an impressive trajectory marked by resilience, adaptability, and a keen focus on client success. Their continuous evolution is demonstrated by their merger with Cost Control Associates in 2020, proving their ambition to expand and refine their service offerings. Their contingency-based model also reinforces their dedication, requiring that clients only pay when they witness actual savings.</p>
<br /><p>Spanning multiple industries, from hospitality to telecommunications, SIB’s solutions cover utilities, waste removal, telecom, and more. Their history, combined with their forward-thinking approach, positions them as a dynamic and reliable Schooley Mitchell competitor in the cost reduction consultancy space.</p>
<br /><p>ERC, now a part of the Renodis group, offers specialized services in the utility and telecommunications sectors. This focused approach ensures that their strategies are well-informed and tailored to these specific industries. By concentrating on these areas, ERC provides solutions that are both practical and effective, with an aim to positively impact a business’s bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>Moreover, ERC’s client-centric approach is evident in its flexible fee structure. They cater to various business needs, offering options from shared savings for those preferring incentive-driven audits to monthly or one-time fee arrangements. With an experienced team and a clear focus on their areas of expertise, ERC has established itself as a reliable consultant in the utility and telecommunications fields and one of the more worthy Schooley Mitchell competitors.</p>
<br /><p>Though newer to the scene compared to other players on our list, Util Auditors has quickly expanded its range of services. They offer more than just traditional utility audits, branching out to areas like merchant processing, virtual card platforms, and bank fees. Additionally, they assist with HR-related areas such as payroll, health insurance and employee benefits, workers’ compensation, and 401(K) and 403(B) administration.</p>
<br /><p>This Schooley Mitchell competitor is focused on improving operational efficiency across different service areas. Their method combines various expertise, ensuring each project is well-managed. Util Auditors has completed utility bill audits for both mid-sized businesses and large Fortune 500 companies with many locations. Using top-notch technology solutions, they pinpoint areas for operational savings, aiming to be a complete resource for their clients.</p>
<br /><p>Navigating the world of cost reduction can be a daunting task. With so many options available, businesses need a trusted partner who not only offers a depth of expertise but also genuinely understands and caters to their unique needs. While Schooley Mitchell and these Schooley Mitchell competitors provide valuable services in this arena, the true differentiator lies in individualized attention, diverse expertise, and tangible results.</p>
<br /><p>This is where P3 Cost Analysts truly shine. Established even before Schooley Mitchell, P3 boasts over three decades of industry knowledge. But it’s not just about longevity. Every P3 consultant brings a depth of understanding and a personal touch that’s often lacking in larger firms like Schooley Mitchell. In a world where bigger often gets misconstrued as better, P3 Cost Analysts serves as a reminder that tailored solutions, genuine partnerships, and proven results are what truly matter.</p>

<br /><p>Many of today’s companies fail to realize the importance of auditing utility budgets and the accompanying monthly charges. Too often spending in this category is not verified due to an assumption of accuracy and cost efficiency. We often hear “as long as it looks right, we pay them.” It is not good business to pay invoices based on an assumption. The utility company’s position is that it is your responsibility to verify your bills. By assuming your bills are correct or there is nothing you can do leaves your company vulnerable to errors and overcharges. P3 Cost Analysts helps you take back control of your budget and spending for utility and telecommunications. A utility audit may be the best thing you can do now and in the future for your company, with the potential of refunds and savings going straight to your bottom line.</p>
<br /><p>In an attempt to make sure money spent is not money wasted, we offer the following services:</p>

<br /><p>When businesses ﬁrst consider ways to cut utility costs, they typically think in terms of reducing usage. From installing energy efficient light bulbs and switches to lowering water consumption, these tactics are often the only thoughts that come to mind. And though reducing usage is a good practice, businesses are missing many savings opportunities on utilities by assuming that utilities costs themselves are largely ﬁxed. </p>
<br /><p>With the utility industry being highly regulated, it’s easy to see why many companies fall under the ﬁxed cost assumption. Because utility tariffs and fees are so complex, unless you have a utility expert looking under the hood of your utility statements and actually knowing what to look for, there are many errors and overcharges that will go unnoticed.</p>
<br /><p>To see any real change in utility savings, a deep audit of your records and statements is a necessity. Some may think they have people in-house that are already monitoring for errors, but the fact is, utility cost auditing requires specialty training that is never their core competency. </p>
<br /><p>In this white paper, we will outline how the utility industry functions, explore the types of errors and overcharges that go unnoticed, reveal how our experts at P3 Cost Analysts work through an auditing process, and share some examples of tangible savings we discover for clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Most businesses may know whether or not they operate in a regulated or deregulated energy market. If their energy provider has a government granted monopoly in the state or region, then they’re in a regulated market. If multiple providers compete to be their energy provider, they’re in a deregulated market. The type of market a business functions in depends on the state in which they’re located, with the majority of states operating in a regulated market.</p>
<br /><p>In regulated markets, the utility provider is a single entity that handles the entire supply chain of energy. In deregulated markets, on the other hand, while there may still be one main energy provider, they can sell energy to multiple third parties, who set their own rates and become the energy suppliers for the business. In either regulated or deregulated markets, it’s always up to the consumer, not the vendor, to ﬁnd savings.</p>
<br /><p>Energy Tariffs apply to both regulated and deregulated markets and dictate how much energy suppliers charge customers based on their type of industry, usage, time of usage, and many other factors outlined in lengthy and complex documents.</p>
<br /><p>It’s highly difficult (if not impossible) for non-experts to understand how these tariffs are billed because there are so many provisions, and they’re written for the utility company, not for the customer to understand. You can click here to try and calculate a simple electric bill. You also automatically get billed for all tariffs riders unless you take action to opt out. And even when you do take action to opt out, the utility company might tell you that you’ll lose other beneﬁts if you do not implement changes correctly.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>A manufacturing company may qualify for a lower tier of billing if 40% of their energy usage comes from natural gas. However, this incentive only applies if the business is using that natural gas at certain times of the day. As such, if the business isn’t aware of the incentive or doesn’t have the right tracking systems in place to take advantage of the incentive, they may miss out on savings.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>All of the errors found in the billing process are based on algorithms, numbers, improper calculations, and impossibilities. With our expertise, we understand what the utility companies are liable for in regards to errors. This allows us to determine whether refunds are applicable or not and to prove to the utility company how a certain error occurred within their own regulations.</p>
<br /><p>Hours used can be deﬁned as the number of hours you used your electricity based on your peak demand.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>If a company uses 50,000 kWh and has a peak demand of 100kW, the hours used is 500 (50,000/100 = 500). In a 30-day bill cycle, there is a maximum of 720 hours (24 hours x 30 days). If the hours used in a 30-day bill cycle computes 750 hours, it simply is an impossibility, and we know there is an error.</p>
<br /><p>This efficiency percentage can never be greater than 100%. Thus, if the load factor calculation the utility company presents is over 100%, there is a clear error.</p>
<br /><p>Utility companies are allowed to estimate bills based on the history of the business’ electrical usage, but that estimate can be wrong upon closer inspection of the records. One area we look at is estimated demands. “Demand” is the highest amount of energy, measured in kilowatts of kilovolts, that a company uses over a short period of time. Many electric meters require the demand to be reset to zero after each meter read.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>If the estimated demand is 100 kW, but the previous actual meter read was 90 kW and the next actual read was 70 kW, we know it’s impossible for the demand to be 100 kW this time because they must not have reset the meter after the previous reading.</p>
<br /><p>A demand ratchet is the percentage of your peak demand that you have to pay each month even if you don’t use that energy. We look for times when the demand reading might trigger a demand ratchet or other multipliers that bring the client into a higher tier for kilowatt charges and make the necessary changes to fall under the correct tier. Without these ﬁxes, a client could stay in the wrong pricing tier for up to 12 months, leading to many extra charges.</p>
<br /><p>These percentages vary, and if you do not understand them, you can fall into a higher ratchet than you need to be.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>A company is currently paying 100% of their demand ratchet. But since they heat their buildings with 100% electricity instead of gas, their tari. allows them to pay a 50% demand ratchet. Until this gets noticed, they will be wasting a lot of money that they don’t need to.</p>
<br /><p>In most water billing errors, there’s an issue with how a company is being billed for their sewage. Sewage billing is based on a percentage of water consumption, which in many states is 100%. Some companies, however, are billed at 100% of water consumption when in fact not all of their water is going into sewage.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>Breweries use large quantities of water to brew their beer, but that water isn’t going back into sewage - it’s going out into the tap room and out the door in cans. Thus, they shouldn’t be charged 100% for sewage based on how they use their water.</p>
<br /><p>Many municipalities use computers to read the meters. If the data is not entered into the computer correctly on the front end, or if the computer simply makes an error, overcharges can occur.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>We went to work for one client and noticed the water meter was being read correctly. However, due to an error in the software, the sewer usage was being calculated at a rate of 10x. Thus, while the fees and readings themselves were accurate, the usage calculation was not. This resulted in a 10x overcharge on the client’s sewer fees.</p>
<br /><p>Most of the errors with gas involve the utility company not billing based on the contractual terms. A customer will enter into a contract with a utility company, but the utility company won’t act according to the contractual terms.</p>
<br /><p>With some tariffs and regions, the tariffs are set to change automatically. This means that if usage falls or increases, a customer may be moved or ‘defaulted’ into a lower or higher tariffs bracket. Generally, this will result in the most cost-effective rate for the customer. However, these automatic changes routinely fail to occur. Only through a deep analysis of historical usage can a customer determine if an error has occurred.</p>
<br /><p>For example:</p>
<br /><p>We had one client who had four different natural gas accounts. Two of them were billed on the General Large tariffs and two of them were billed on the General Small tariffs. The usage, however, indicated that all four accounts should have been billed on the General Small tariffs.</p>
<br /><p>The vendor initially fought this claim, as they did not want to issue a refund for the mistake or reduce their revenue. However, after escalating the claim up to the vendor’s senior management, we were able to recover the overcharge.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>When you consider the complexity of tariffs and the numerous errors that can occur in the utility billing process, it makes sense to do a deep audit and reap the savings of doing so. With the P3 Utility Auditing solution, you can take advantage of this auditing process risk free. There’s no charge for the hundreds of hours of upfront auditing time by our experts. We simply receive 50% of the</p>
<br /><p>savings we find for a period of 60 months. About 99% of the time, clients allow us to implement what we find because our recommendations make sense and produce real savings.</p>
<br /><p>Note: The process below mostly applies to companies in regulated markets. In deregulated markets, P3 simply acts as an energy broker monitoring the market, knowing the best time to lock in a contract, and receiving a small commission on these arrangements. There are still opportunities to ﬁnd billing errors, but we don’t share in the kilowatt per hour rate reductions like we do in regulated markets.</p>
<br /><p>We schedule a 15-20 minute meeting to explain our shared savings agreement and the materials we need to get started, including copies of invoices and authorization documents.</p>
<br /><p>We work with the client to gain access to 12 - 36 months of invoices, depending on the statute of limitations in their state (often, if we have the vendor online logins, we may only need a single invoice).</p>
<br /><p>Our experts start dissecting invoices and provide the client with weekly or bi-weekly updates on overcharges and errors found. We also deliver these savings as we go instead of waiting until the end of the audit.</p>
<br /><p>This phase can take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to get the initial results for a mid-size client, and then once these ﬁndings are represented to the client, it can take another 4-6 weeks to get those savings implemented, depending on which part of the billing cycle we step in.</p>
<br /><p>After the initial audit, we move into the ongoing auditing phase where we monitor invoices every month and make sure errors don’t continue to appear and that the savings are intact.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In some cases, clients have been in business for decades and think that what they’re doing “works” and they don’t need to change anything. Some may also look at the P3 Utility Auditing solution as “too good to be true,” leading to general skepticism about the offering.</p>
<br /><p>Others believe the people they have in-house monitoring utility charges are sufficient. The controller or accounts payable department is typically the one in charge of managing this, but this area is never anyone’s core competency. While these people have hundreds of other things on their plates, they may worry about us making them look bad when we ﬁnd many savings that went unnoticed previously.</p>
<br /><p>In response to these objections, it should be clariﬁed that our sole purpose is to optimize savings, and that the time and expertise involved to audit these correctly is immense. What companies are already doing may work to an extent, but we have the expertise to take savings to the next level. We provide a valuable service that supplements and supports our clients moving forward. It’s a win-win relationship that has proven results.</p>
<br /><p>Through this analysis, it has become clear that achieving real savings on utilities is complex. Between all the nuances with tariffs and billing, it’s difﬁcult for customers to ﬁnd these savings on their own. Luckily, with the help of utility auditing experts, a number of errors can be discovered through a detailed audit leading to many savings. And the best part of this process is that it’s risk free, with no upfront charges and only savings.</p>

<br /><p>With our guidance, you can use the money you save on shipping to run specials like free shipping or discounts on top-selling products. Our clients have outpaced competitors and seen double-digit increases in both revenue and market share.</p>
<br /><p>Negotiate a better deal with your favorite carrier or explore a new carrier’s rates for a potential new level of savings. Either way, you’ll have more money in your pocket with zero new costs incurred. With P3, you pay nothing out of pocket. We’re only paid a share of what we actually save your business.</p>
<br /><p>On top of our negotiation expertise, we help clients get credits back from overcharges. Did you know that every year, billions of dollars in shipping refunds go unclaimed? It’s true. Out of $2 billion in parcel audit credit refunds owed by shipping carriers each year, a full 75% go unclaimed. That’s $1.5 billion!</p>
<br /><p>The fact is, if your company ships and receives packages with carriers like FedEx and UPS, you could be entitled to thousands of dollars in refunds. Every time a package arrives even just a few minutes late, you’re likely owed a refund on its shipping cost.</p>
<br /><p>On average, 3% to 5% of packages are delivered late every day. But you only have 15 days to claim your money. It isn’t just late deliveries that are the problem. Billing errors can occur on every carrier invoice you receive. The problem is that carrier invoices can be hundreds of pages long every week.</p>
<br /><p>Thankfully, there’s P3. Our team of auditors will conduct a thorough, 45-point parcel audit on each of your shipments. Our proprietary software not only gets you back all of the money you are owed, but also automates the refund process. Which means you can just sit back and watch your refund credits pile up.</p>

<br /><p>Reducing costs for telecom services is quite difficult for the average customer.</p>
<br /><p>Between a lack of transparency around telecom billing tactics, and vendors frequently not billing according to their own contracts, customers tend to overpay for these services without knowing it.</p>
<br /><p>To find errors, overcharges, and breaches of contract, it takes a high level of knowledge and me that a typical customer doesn’t have. Ultimately, it takes a thorough audit by telecom industry experts to truly start cutting costs in this expense category.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a closer look at the telecom industry, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring</p>
<br /><p>to our customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The telecom industry in the modern age provides wired and mobile phone services, Internet services, and a variety of other data transmission services. Previously, when there were only a few vendors servicing the market, telecom was more regulated than it is today. Once more and more vendors came to the market, the government decided to make it a completely open market, letting companies compete and set their pricing.</p>
<br /><p>Though telecom is an open market, vendors must still outline tariffs that exist as an agreement between themselves, regulating bodies, and customers as to how much they charge for their services. Vendors are no longer required to file their tariffs with the FCC, but many still choose to do so. Others file them with state-level utility commissions and also publish them on their websites.</p>
<br /><p>While there is regulator on in the telecom industry via the Federal Communications Commission, vendors tend to keep their billing tactics as secret as possible. They don’t want customers questioning their bills and therefore don’t release certain billing information unless a customer specifically calls in and requests it. The issue is, even if a customer requests more details about their bill, they o en won’t be able to understand the complex language or figure out if they are actually being overcharged.</p>
<br /><p>Another issue is that customers simply don’t know what they don’t know. They think their IT or billing department is checking to make sure they are getting the best price, but these in-house employees rarely have the knowledge and industry expertise required to optimize spending on telecom services. Their expert se lies in keeping the technology running, rather than figuring out if they are being billed accurately and at the most efficient cost.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Below are the key areas of telecom billing that P3 Cost Analysts audits in order to discover errors, overcharges, and other areas of dispute.</p>
<br /><p>A customer service record is a very detailed report of what telecom services a customer uses, what rates they’re charged at, and how these rates are calculated. Anyone can request these records but many customers don’t even know they exist. Even if a customer does request these records, they won’t be able to understand them because they are written in a computer-generated code that only a trained expert would understand. It would even be difficult for a finance director or CFO to understand these documents.</p>
<br /><p>Here’s an example of what a portion of a CSR looks like:</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>At P3 we have trained experts who know how to read these documents and find errors or overcharges. Within these customer service records we look for:</p>
<br /><p>Another key way in which we find savings is by comparing the customer service records described above with a vendor's outlined tariffs to make sure the vendor is actually following their pricing guidelines.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, finding these tariffs can be difficult. Luckily, at P3 we know how to access these documents in order to compare them to a customer’s CSR.</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, vendors aren’t following their pricing guidelines and at other times they’re simply misapplying tariffs. Both of which we can verify and correct if needed.</p>
<br /><p>You would be amazed by how many telecom vendors don’t bill according to their contracts. In many cases, discrepancies with contracts revolve around discounts not being applied to the customer’s account properly.</p>
<br /><p>Here are some examples:</p>
<br /><p>P3 can also help clients enroll in new contracts. Some times a client’s contract has expired and they fall under casual rates without knowing it. These rates are much much higher than contract rates and we help customers get back into a fair contract as quickly as possible.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The key reason we audit terms and conditions is to find out how far back we can look for disputes and what kind of credits can be reapplied to a client’s account. In a lot of cases, when we open a dispute from a while ago, the vendor will just try to issue a customary three- to six-month credit instead of the full amount. We’ve been in the industry long enough to know that we don’t have to accept this offer.</p>
<br /><p>We are able to understand the language outlined in the terms and conditions in order to bring our clients the refund they deserve based on when the actual error occurred. Vendors typically comply with our requests so that the FCC doesn’t need to get involved, but there have been rare instances where we have taken a dispute to the FCC.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather customer service records, pull tariffs, and request contracts from the telecom companies. In most cases, gathering this info can take 5–10 days, or even up to a month with some vendors.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we apply decades of expertise in this industry to review and compare contracts, customer service records, and tariffs, searching for errors and overcharges. We also run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4–6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our findings and recommendations in a savings letter. The client can then authorize us to move forward with negotiating with the telecom vendors.</p>
<br /><p>Once our findings are approved, we work with the vendor to secure new agreements, resolve disputes, and set up the most cost-efficient telecom programs.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure that savings stay intact and vendors honor their agreements and pricing. We have found vendors are constantly violating their own agreements and we monitor and fight off unwarranted price increases and overcharges on our client's behalf. Furthermore, we monitor market conditions and look for ways to keep costs down or drive them lower.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>P3 averages finding clients savings of 15-30% on their telecom expenses. Below are some examples of work we’ve done for our clients.</p>
<br /><p>With this particular school system, the client was paying great rates for all of their telecom services. Most other aspects of the audit confirmed that there were no overcharges or opportunities for savings. However, the client did have a PRI that was being billed incorrectly. They also had associated taxes and fees that were being overbilled. The vendor had simply misentered the allowable charges (per the tariff) on the client’s account. It had been billed in error for 14 years. We identified this error and began working to have it fixed by the vendor. Countless employees at the vendor would not acknowledge this was indeed an error. They did not understand their own tariff and believed it to be billed correctly. After finally finding someone at the vendor who agreed it was an error, they offered a 3-month refund of the overcharge, claiming that was all they were legally required to refund. We knew this was not true.</p>
<br /><p>We knew with this particular type of error the client should have it refunded back to the point of error.</p>
<br /><p>After many more calls with the vendor, and even seeing this escalated up to the CFO of the vendor company, our client received a $150,000 refund check in the mail and saw their bill reduced by over $3,000/month.</p>
<br /><p>A city was charged for about 50 business lines on a consolidated bill and individual contracts and the business lines were not under contract with a particular vendor. As a result, the city was charged very high rates for the business lines. P3 Cost Analysts worked with the telecom vendor to negotiate lower rates for the business lines. Once the business lines were placed under contract, P3 Cost Analysts were able to reduce the charges by $5,100 per month.</p>
<br /><p>The wireless accounts for a company were not receiving any discounts. P3 Cost Analysts negotiated with the wireless carrier and applied discounts to the wireless accounts. By adding the discounts, P3 Cost Analysts were able to reduce the client’s bill by $1,000 per month.</p>

<br /><p>Our merchant processing audit service helps businesses that accept credit cards for payment.  </p>
<br /><p>Many businesses accept credit cards and most understand how to negotiate their base fee.   </p>
<br /><p>If you are a business owner and have looked at your statements and bills though, you may not be surprised to know that there can be a litany of other fees that dot your credit card processing statements as well. How these are calculated is often shrouded in mystery and can be very difficult to understand. These fees often contain errors and overcharges as well. </p>

<br /><p>Any business that accepts credit cards or other electronic payment methods works with a merchant processing provider. Also known as payment processing providers or credit card processing providers, these third-party entities are the middlemen between you (the merchant) and card-issuing banks.</p>
<br /><p>Without knowing any better, most businesses shop around for the best processing rates and think that’s all they can do to minimize costs in this area. But, only around 20% of possible savings for customers come from negotiating better processing rates.</p>
<br /><p>The real savings on merchant processing services can only be uncovered through a detailed merchant processing audit.</p>
<br /><p>To better understand how you can start cutting merchant processing costs, we’ll take an in-depth look at the moving parts of this industry, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The merchant processing industry is foundational for the facilitation of credit/debit card and other electronic payment transactions across the world. There is a vast amount of merchant service providers, and depending on the size of your company and the tools or services the providers oﬀer, some will be a better ﬁt for your business than others.</p>
<br /><p>Though the services oﬀered by merchant processing providers are pretty similar across the board, fees vary from provider to provider, and so does the level of customer service. Both factors need to be considered when choosing a provider you can rely on.</p>
<br /><p>Any time a business accepts a card payment, the card information gets sent to the merchant processor who then directs the transaction data to the card-issuing bank (the customer’s bank) for approval. Once approved, the processor receives conﬁrmation and directs funds to your merchant account within the acquiring bank.</p>
<br /><p>As you can imagine, this transaction process involves many data exchanges between banks, card companies, and merchant processors. As we’ll see, each link in this chain has criteria by which they base their charges and fees. By understanding how you are charged for these services, you can start to optimize spending in this cost category.</p>
<br /><p>Merchant Processor Transaction Fees:</p>
<br /><p>The transaction fees charged by a merchant processor are what most customers think of when considering fees in this cost category. Whenever a business takes payment that needs to be processed, there is a fee that is paid to the merchant processor. The merchant processor sets these rates based on the margin of</p>
<br /><p>proﬁt they want to receive after they’ve paid out interchange fees to</p>
<br /><p>card-issuing banks.</p>
<br /><p>Interchange Fees:</p>
<br /><p>An interchange is a set of qualiﬁcations and categories that credit card companies use to deﬁne the fees and rates for various types of card transactions. There are many factors that determine these interchange fees including, but not limited to:</p>
<br /><p>To clarify, these interchange fees are set by the card associations and not the merchant processing providers. The merchant processor initially pays these fees to the card-issuing banks, but then these costs ultimately get passed on to the merchant by the processor.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The most signiﬁcant possible savings in this cost category comes from interchange optimization. With so many diﬀerent interchange categories and other qualiﬁcations, it’s common for merchants to be functioning within categories that have higher rates than they actually need to be paying.</p>
<br /><p>At P3 Cost Analysts, we look for situations where merchants can qualify for incentivized or reduced interchange programs based on their SIC code. We seek out solutions merchants can implement that will help them qualify for the lowest interchange possible. Furthermore, we know what the bare minimum margin tolerance merchant processing providers will accept, giving us the insight needed to get the best interchange rates possible.</p>
<br /><p>For Example:</p>
<br /><p>If you own and operate a ﬁtness studio, you have a speciﬁc SIC code for that type of business. But, since you also teach at that studio, you qualify for a special educational interchange category that can reduce your interchange costs.</p>
<br /><p>The average owner would not know they qualify for this interchange because it’s not directly communicated to the owner by the merchant processing provider.</p>
<br /><p>Another way we can optimize interchange fees is by prescribing better payment gateways for merchants. A gateway is a device merchants use to take payment, and each type of device sends certain kinds of data. This data is deﬁned as level 1, level 2, and level 3, with level 3 being the most detailed kind of data. Every time you can process higher-level data, you get a reduction in interchange fees.</p>
<br /><p>With the right gateway, merchants could potentially process level 3 data when they were only processing level 1 or 2 data previously.</p>
<br /><p>Example:</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a B2B construction materials company that was only clearing transactions at levels 1 and 2. We were able to help them implement an oﬀ-the-shelf level 3 solution that ended up saving them over $30K per month in transaction fees without having to change their merchant processing provider.</p>
<br /><p>Merchant processing fee negotiation:</p>
<br /><p>Since we have deep knowledge of industry benchmarks and pricing, we are typically able to negotiate better rates with merchant processing providers. As mentioned earlier, these negotiations only make up about 20% of possible savings.</p>
<br /><p>Eliminating fake fees:</p>
<br /><p>In some cases, merchant processing providers add on fake fees and costs that can be disputed and reimbursed to merchants.</p>
<br /><p>Chargeback fees:</p>
<br /><p>If a merchant has a lot of disputed transactions, these chargeback fees can start adding up quickly. With our expertise, we are able to work with the merchant to reduce the losses from these chargebacks.</p>
<br /><p>Prescribing alternative payment methods:</p>
<br /><p>In cases where the merchant has a lot of recurring transactions, we can implement ACH solutions that clear transactions at a much lower cost than credit cards. This is a good way to eliminate certain credit card transactions and reduce spending.</p>
<br /><p>In rare cases, we’ll help merchants use an aggregator such as PayPal or Square, instead of a traditional merchant processing provider when it makes sense.</p>
<br /><p>Spotting and correcting padded interchange fees:</p>
<br /><p>Some merchant processors will pad their interchange fee, meaning they are adding additional fees on top of the actual interchange costs. We are able to catch this practice in action by looking at a list of the published interchange categories and comparing them to the merchant processor pricing.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather invoices and contract information from clients about their merchant processing provider. In this category, we are often able to obtain this information from the vendors directly, further saving the client time.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we do a thorough assessment of our client’s interchange categories and merchant processing provider fees. Applying decades of expertise in this industry, we run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4–6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our ﬁndings and recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Once our ﬁndings are approved, we work with the merchant processing provider to secure new agreements and set up the most cost-eﬃcient program.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure savings stay intact and providers honor the agreements and pricing.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>With the help of P3 Cost Analysts, our clients are able to save 15%–20% on merchant processing costs.</p>

<br /><p>In some cases, clients don’t think they’ll understand the savings we bring and therefore are uncertain about moving forward. We respond by highlighting the fact that we sit down with all of our clients to explain what the savings are and how we found them. We would never make you pay a savings invoice that you don’t understand or agree with.</p>
<br /><p>Other times, clients worry that they’ll lose a sense of control over their systems and providers. They think that we could make decisions that they don’t agree with. We respond by making it known that we will review any implementations or action steps with them before moving forward with our recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Lastly, some clients think working with us will take too much time. This has never been the case in our many years of merchant processing auditing. In fact, our clients typically spend less than two hours of their own time throughout the entire merchant processing audit.</p>
<br /><p>If you are a business or organization with a high volume of credit card or other electronic payment transactions, the only way you can effectively save on these costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>If you’ve ever been confused about the billing and pricing variables from your uniform and linen provider, you’re not alone.</p>
<br /><p>Between rates that constantly change, and providers using aggressive pricing tactics, businesses everywhere are being overcharged for their uniform and linen services.</p>
<br /><p>In order to understand where you’re being overcharged and to negotiate better rates, it takes expert-level knowledge in this industry. It also takes me and resources that many businesses simply don’t have.</p>
<br /><p>To gain a better understanding of how you can start saving costs on uniform and linen services, let’s take a closer look at how these services are priced, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The uniform and linen industry is largely monopolized by three national uniform providers and one linen provider. Though there are a few smaller local or regional players, most businesses will have to work with the larger providers.</p>
<br /><p>These major providers include:</p>
<br /><p>Since these major providers essentially have a monopoly on the industry, they engage in aggressive pricing tactics and constantly change billing variables to serve their needs and not the customers. Furthermore, there are no uniform billing practices between these providers and they each use their own contract verbiage, which is extremely one-sided in the vendor’s favor. This means you can expect prices to change throughout your contract, often with no recourse.</p>
<br /><p>It’s important to remember that since uniforms and linens are rented, charges are not a one-and-done transaction. There are many variables in play that you’re responsible for on an ongoing basis.</p>
<br /><p>Additionally, it’s important to note that route drivers for these providers are paid based on a percentage of invoices and also by hitting certain KPIs. Bonuses get paid out due to revenue-enhancing metrics such as loss charge revenue, meaning there’s no incentive for them to correct any billing errors.</p>
<br /><p>Here’s an overview of some of these variables:</p>
<br /><p>In most cases, linen and uniform providers are breaching their own contracts and overcharging without valid explanations. It’s common to see costs increase 2-3x the rate of inflation and customers getting 5-10 % annual price increases (at current rates of inflation, 2-3% at the time of writing). Without having your core competency in the uniform and linen industry, customers won’t know what to look for or how to dispute these surcharges.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>To start our engagement with clients, we need a signed service agreement and letter of authorization to obtain the info we need from suppliers. We also need your current uniform and linen service agreement, as well as the last 4 weeks of relevant invoices.</p>
<br /><p>It will take us 2-3 weeks to work through a full audit of your invoices and to report our initial findings.</p>
<br /><p>During this me, we will look at contract compliance and dive into each of the pricing variables, looking for errors and overcharges. We typically review over 50 different pricing and term variables on every uniform and linen agreement.</p>
<br /><p>With our industry expertise, we are able to see what you are being charged in relation to nationwide standards and alternative product or service solutions. Typically, we are able to find an average of 35% in savings.</p>
<br /><p>Once we’ve compiled our findings, we will have a 20- to 30-minute call with our clients to discuss a negotiation strategy, then get to work renegotiating their contracts. We leverage our national database of vendor benchmarks, and inside knowledge of the vendors (having worked for them in the past), to drive savings for our clients. We typically stay with the incumbent vendor unless our clients have had issues with them in the past and are wanting to change.</p>
<br /><p>Alongside negotiating better terms for our clients, we will receive refunds or rebates for past overcharges 30-40% of the time. This largely depends on the previous contractual language and if addendums or special terms and conditions were added.</p>
<br /><p>Knowing how to find the savings and how to negotiate them is one thing, but in this industry, the vendors are constantly getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar.</p>
<br /><p>Even with a properly negotiated contract and properly negotiated terms and conditions, providers will find ways to increase these costs, in violation of their own agreed-upon contract.</p>
<br /><p>Further complicating things is the fact that most clients have dozens of line items being billed. It can be difficult to catch a $.02 increase on a mop handle, or towel, that violates the agreement. And even if caught, it can take a mountain of work to reach out to the vendor to have this corrected. These errors happen amongst almost all providers and can add up to significant costs.</p>
<br /><p>During the Ongoing Audit phase, we monitor these expenses for our clients, making sure vendors stay compliant to their contracts - and fighting on our client’s behalf when they don’t.</p>
<br /><p>Multi-location Auto Dealership</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a growing auto dealership that had 17 different locations and was spending around $140,000 annually on uniforms, mats, towels, and other industrial laundry items. Before we started working with them, they had two different suppliers that the CFO and Fixed Ops Director were unsatisfied with due to poor communication, increased invoices, and speed of product repairs.</p>
<br /><p>P3 Cost Analysts audited every contract and invoice line item from all locations and brought these results to the auto dealership. After months of negotiations with the suppliers, we were able to:</p>
<br /><p>Large Country Club</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a Country Club that was spending over $220,000 per year for their industrial laundry services. They had one supplier for their landscaping department and one for their club and service branch. The CFO tried meeting with these vendors to understand the club’s billing but never got any straight answers.</p>
<br /><p>We came in and did a full audit of the existing contracts and invoices. Since this was a complex account, we did an onsite visit to better understand their operations. Once we had our initial findings, we started negotiating better pricing, product quality, and service guarantees.</p>
<br /><p>Through our negotiations, we were able to:</p>
<br /><p>Grocery Store Chain</p>
<br /><p>We went to work at a 26-location on grocery store chain spending over $250,000/year on laundry services. We started digging into the existing contracts and invoicing for every line item of all store locations. We discovered that the Master Agreement was not properly executed and that there were 3 different suppliers with inconsistent pricing and terms. The Master Agreement had 25 contracted items, yet there were 139 on the invoices. We compiled all of the results with projected savings for the Initial Analysis and Strategy Meeting. The client selected the strategy to move forward to achieve the best pricing, terms, and product/pricing controls.</p>
<br /><p>Results</p>
<br /><p>We reviewed all the in-service products, inventories, and store placements by store to maximize the service and cost. Successful negotiations resulted in best pricing, terms, product quality, and a dedicated National Account customer service manager.</p>
<br /><p>Our work produced 30% total savings for a total of $75,000/year.</p>
<br /><p>Many businesses have an in-house procurement team and believe that this is sufficient to avoid overcharges. But, in many cases, industrial laundry pricing is not their core competency.</p>
<br /><p>It should be noted that we are in no way trying to replace these teams, but rather we are a source of expertise to support their efforts. We often help businesses save around 30%-50% on industrial laundry services even when businesses have a procurement team.</p>
<br /><p>Working through every line item and continually reviewing invoices is very intensive and requires a great deal of me that these teams may not have. We also have the knowledge and skills required to speak with the industrial laundry providers’ upper-level management. Often, these people aren’t accessible to the original procurement team.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re more than a mom-and-pop type business, the only way you can effectively save on uniform and linen service costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or you need to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>Between waste vendors’ confusing contractual language and customers not knowing which charges are valid, companies all across the country overpay for waste and recycling without realizing it.</p>
<br /><p>To find the applicable overcharges and invalid fees to reduce your business's surcharge, you need a trained eye. More specifically, you need professionals whose core competency is waste and recycling auditing and billing to thoroughly understand where your business is overpaying.</p>
<br /><p>Let’s take a look at how the waste and recycling industry prices their services, the valid and invalid reasons for fees and changes in billing, and how the P3 Cost Analysts’ Waste Management auditing solution finds real savings for customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>What makes the $40+ billion waste and recycling industry so complex is that there’s rarely set pricing for the services they sell. Sales reps have incentives for selling services at higher prices, which leads to differences in what customers pay depending on their rep. In many cases, people will pay vastly different prices for the same service depending on whether they negotiate using key benchmark data or simply accept their representative's offer.</p>
<br /><p>Even if you sign a contract that you’re happy with at the outset, this price can completely change three, six, or nine months down the line. In most cases, these contracts are three years long. Many of these contracts also have an auto-renewal clause, and if you’re not paying attention, you could get roped into another three years without realizing it.</p>
<br /><p>There are two types of markets for waste: Open Markets and Franchised Markets.</p>
<br /><p>In franchised markets, the government has negotiated the prices for business owners in that city or community and contracted with a private waste hauler. The pricing is set by the government. Governments typically negotiate free services for government facilities in exchange for the private hauler receiving the monopoly rights to service the businesses in that community.</p>
<br /><p>Unfortunately, these deals o en result in businesses paying well above market rates for their waste and recycling services. The governments negotiating these agreements are not experts in the waste and recycling industry, and, in our experience, the costs passed on to businesses are almost always higher than open market rates.</p>
<br /><p>While businesses cannot negotiate a lower price in these markets, there are o en savings to be found due to errors and overcharges, haulers not following the franchise agreement, or options to use alternative and more efficient equipment (like compactors, balers, or other types of dumpsters) in these markets.</p>
<br /><p>Open markets comprise the vast majority in the United States. In these markets, the government has let the choice of waste hauler up to the individual business. With this freedom of choice, however, comes responsibility.</p>
<br /><p>Since there’s limited regulation within the waste management industry, vendors can structure their contracts and invoicing to solely benefit themselves. The contract language they use typically allows them to tack on additional fees for whatever reasons they want. Additionally, there’s no effective way to file a formal complaint about these contracts or any unexpected surcharges. Businesses must ‘vote with their feet’ and change haulers - or negotiate themselves to have an impact. However, the complexity of hauler agreements can make it seem impossible to make changes.</p>
<br /><p>Furthermore, each waste market is vastly different. A waste market even one county away could have drastically different pricing depending on the landfill location, local regulations, and a myriad of other pricing concerns. The only way to truly know whether it’s a good deal is to have benchmark pricing data from customer locations all over the country.</p>
<br /><p>So, while open markets can result in better pricing for businesses, they only do so if they are negotiated and handled correctly, and by experts in the industry.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, deciphering these charges and understanding the contractual language is almost impossible. Waste and recycling companies know this and are good at making certain fees sound mandatory when, in fact, they are not. Many customers just accept the charges or assume waste and recycling fees are fixed like other business costs. Without experience and proper market information, they lack the negotiating power and simply tend to accept the waste company's charges at face value.</p>
<br /><p>Luckily, there are steps businesses can take to avoid unnecessary fees and overcharges. The most impactful thing they can do is work through a full waste audit led by a professional team. At P3 Cost Analysts, we are experts in the waste and recycling industry, have over 30,000 client benchmark data points across the country, and know exactly what to look for in regards to valid and invalid charges.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In many cases, the fee increases you see are valid and usually aren’t a cause for concern. However, even valid fee increases can be misapplied and the overall cost burden placed on the customer. Generally speaking, you can expect a standard price increase of 15% per year if you sign a contract as is and don’t take any additional steps - and that is with current inflation rates, which fall at around 3%. As inflation increases you can expect the price increases from haulers to reach an even higher rate.</p>
<br /><p>Fee Increases and Additional Charges</p>
<br /><p>Government Regulation Changes</p>
<br /><p>Some coun es and ci es have franchise fees for haulers to be able to operate there. These fees then get passed on to customers.</p>
<br /><p>Landfill Price Increases</p>
<br /><p>These happen when landfills, both privately and publicly owned, increase charges and these are passed through to the haulers, who then pass them on to customers.</p>
<br /><p>Labor Cost Increase</p>
<br /><p>When employees get paid more, customers will also pay more. Minimum wage and local labor market conditions all factor into the price of your waste and recycling expenses.</p>
<br /><p>Fuel Cost Increase</p>
<br /><p>As fuel prices rise, waste and recycling companies need a way to offset these additional fees.</p>
<br /><p>While these are legitimate reasons for rising costs, the level increased is not always valid.</p>
<br /><p>Examples</p>
<br /><p>Waste and recycling companies will use legitimate regulations to increase your costs more than their costs have gone up.</p>
<br /><p>Or</p>
<br /><p>The calculation of the cost increase is an internal proprietary process, so you’ll never really know how they arrived at their new number.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Valid increases are expected to some extent, but there are many invalid reasons waste and recycling companies increase fees or overcharge. Unfortunately, they can raise pricing for any reason they want. These fees haven’t always existed, and the waste management companies seem to keep inventing new fees as the years go on. Most of the fees and overcharges are intentional and a profit motive that, left unchecked, can get out of control.</p>
<br /><p>Fuel Fees</p>
<br /><p>There’s no way to accurately calculate how much fuel companies in the waste industry actually use. Fifteen years ago, there was no fuel fee because it was included in the base rate. When the fuel market exploded about a decade ago, some waste companies’ fuel fees went up 25%+, but then when the fuel market tanked, their fuel charges never went back down, or only dropped by a small percentage.</p>
<br /><p>Recyclable Material Offset Charge</p>
<br /><p>This vague fee is an additional fee o en seen for customers that have a recycling service.</p>
<br /><p>Overflow Fees</p>
<br /><p>This fee is added if your lid is propped open too high, even if you have only something small hanging out under the lid. Trucks now have cameras that can take photo evidence of overflows. They’ll even charge you if they are a day late and your bin is overflowing because of it. The problem is not so much the existence of this fee, but the cost and the subjective manner in which it is applied.</p>
<br /><p>Example</p>
<br /><p>If you have an $80/month trash bill and the waste company charges you a $120 overflow fee for having your lid propped open one inch, that’s illegitimate and unnecessary.</p>
<br /><p>Container Maintenance Fees</p>
<br /><p>This is a monthly fee to keep your trash container looking good and acts like a type of insurance for your container. But since the waste company owns the container, this is essentially pointless for the customer. This fee was created by many of the larger haulers over the past few years.</p>
<br /><p>Extra Pickup Charges</p>
<br /><p>If a customer has a busy week, they may need an additional waste pickup. Though some sort of charge is reasonable, the waste companies tend to drastically overcharge these extra pickups. This is because the waste companies’ contracts generally allow them to charge what they want.</p>
<br /><p>Exchange, Removal, and Delivery Fees</p>
<br /><p>If you get a leaky dumpster or need to upgrade to a different size, you’ll likely incur an exchange fee. But what sometimes happens is they’ll charge you for an exchange but also tack on a removal and delivery fee. In reality, the exchange fee is just removal + delivery so being charged for all three is unnecessary.</p>
<br /><p>Overhauling</p>
<br /><p>Some companies will haul waste and recycling to a landfill much farther than they have to go, thus incurring more hauling charges for the customer. This could be because they own the landfill further away and have better margins there, or just want to be able to charge higher haul (distance) rates. Knowing the landscape of the local landfills and your options is paramount to keeping your waste expenses under control.</p>
<br /><p>Misclassification of Waste</p>
<br /><p>Sometimes people may have "regular" waste, yet the vendor classifies it as a liquid or hazardous waste. Whether their classification is valid or not, this means they have to take it to a different part of the landfill where it’s put into a different place than where normal waste goes, incurring an additional charge.</p>
<br /><p>Contamination for Recycling</p>
<br /><p>If you put your recycling in a plastic bag (which is not recyclable), they can charge you $150 for contamination.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>At P3 Cost Analysts, we have staff who have worked in this industry for decades and know all the intricacies around pricing and contracts. We know the regional minimum amounts that waste and recycling companies will agree to, and we fight to get these prices for our clients.</p>
<br /><p>The best part is our clients don’t pay a cent un l we find savings. From there we share in the savings 50/50 each month.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Example 1</p>
<br /><p>We had a client who was in a franchise market which meant they could only work with one waste industry vendor. For this reason, we weren’t able to go through our typical contract negotiation but were able to find savings in other ways.</p>
<br /><p>Our experts recognized that the waste loads the vendor was hauling were much lighter than they should’ve been in comparison to our known standards for the equipment the client was using. We conducted a site visit for the client and realized their waste compactor was not functioning properly. It was only compacting the trash to 1⁄3 of the normal opera ng range for that piece of equipment, which caused the compactor to show it was full before it actually was.</p>
<br /><p>We were then able to get the equipment fixed, thus increasing the waste loads they were sending each trip by 2.5x. This, in turn, reduced the number of times our client needed their waste vendor to make trips to the landfill.</p>
<br /><p>This improvement ended up saving our client about $20K/year.</p>
<br /><p>Example 2</p>
<br /><p>Our client had 70 locations in the fast-food industry with different waste contracts for each location. About 80% of the locations were already recycling cardboard, but some were not. And the ones that were, were not doing so efficiently.</p>
<br /><p>We decided to set up recycling for cardboard at several locations and reduced the amount of cardboard going to the landfill, thereby making them more green.</p>
<br /><p>This new recycling program generated a couple thousand dollars in savings alone.</p>
<br /><p>We also renegotiated their contracts to get them the lowest price they deserved. All in all, these re-negotiated contracts and other implementations saved the client over $200,000/year.</p>
<br /><p>Example 3</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a medical company that regularly had hazardous materials to dispose of. If there’s a significant amount of blood on something, it has to be hauled away in special bags and containers.</p>
<br /><p>The medical waste portion of the industry is dominated by a couple of vendors, so they’re very aggressive with their pricing tactics.</p>
<br /><p>This particular client was an ophthalmology clinic paying $3,000/month for one box of medical waste hauled off a week. We were able to get their cost down to $300/month (90% reduction), and this was just the initial savings.</p>
<br /><p>Over the long term, we were able to get them to a price point of around $75/month. These savings were generated by leveraging our expertise around benchmarks from what others around the region were paying.</p>
<br /><p>Example 4</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a medium-sized industrial client in California, which happens to be a highly regulated market.</p>
<br /><p>In this case, we were able to reduce their weight cost as well as their base cost.</p>
<br /><p>This was accomplished by removing a series of minimum charges their vendor was applying. Instead of paying a full 5-ton fee per pickup (even when they had much less), they now are charged for an amount much closer to the actual weight of the waste they dispose of.</p>
<br /><p>In total, this client was able to save around $2,000 per month due to our implementations.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>Without understanding the work we do, a lot of people think there’s just nothing P3 can do to help them or that our service is “too good to be true.” Our response is “why not give it a shot?”</p>
<br /><p>If we can’t help our clients, then it costs them nothing. But if we do find areas of improvement, they can greatly increase their savings. In more cases than not, there are opportunities to reduce costs and increase efficiencies.</p>
<br /><p>If you’re more than a mom-and-pop type business, the only way you can effectively save on waste and recycling costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the waste and recycling industry, or you need to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>The Employee Retention Credit (ERC) was created by the CARES ACT of 2020 to provide relief to businesses who were adversely affected by the Coronavirus Pandemic. This $370 Billion stimulus package provides funding to small businesses who retained their employees during the crisis. The ERC was improved and extended by both the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 and the Covid-19 Relief Package of 2021. While the legislation has changed multiple times the current law allows businesses who experienced a significant reduction in revenue during Covid to qualify, as well as businesses who faced some sort of full or partial restrictions on their business.  Our team assists in determining eligibility for the ERC and does all of the relevant calculations and filings to help our clients maximize the amount of funding available. </p>
<br /><p>For 2020, the ERC provides a fully refundable credit of up to $5,000 per employee for businesses with 100 employees or less. Employers with between 101 and 500 employees can still qualify for the credit, but only on wages paid to employees NOT to work.</p>
<br /><p>For 2021, the ERC provides a fully refundable credit of up to $7,000 per employee for each qualifying quarter in 2021, and the employee count threshold was increased from 100 to 500. The credit is currently available for the first three quarters of 2021. In total, an employer can receive up to $26,000 ($5,000 + $7,000 + $7,000 + $7,000) per employee for the years 2020 and 2021.</p>
<br /><p>Businesses with less than 100 employees in 2020 and/or less than 500 employees in</p>
<br /><p>2021 must meet one of the two requirements below to qualify for ERC.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>1. Curtailment of Operations</p>
<br /><p>Full or partial suspension of business operations as a result of government order, OR;</p>
<br /><p>2. Significant Decline in Gross Receipts</p>
<br /><p>2020 - Decline in gross receipts defined as 50% or greater than their gross receipts in the same quarter of 2019.</p>
<br /><p>2021 - Decline in gross receipts defined as 20% or greater than their gross receipts in the same quarter of 2019.</p>
<br /><p>Beginning January 1, 2021 and through December 31, 2021, employers who received PPP loans may still qualify for the ERC with respect to wages that are not paid for with forgiven PPP proceeds retroactive to the CARES ACT. In addition, not-for-profit organizations may also qualify for the ERC credit.</p>
<br /><p>Obtaining the credit</p>
<br /><p>Our tax professionals will review the relevant financial records to calculate the dollar amount of the eligible employer's expected credit. Our team will then complete and file the relevant IRS forms for the employer and retain all the necessary documentation.</p>
<br /><p>Zero out-of-pocket Costs</p>
<br /><p>We do not charge an upfront fee for this service. Financial compensation to our tax team only occurs after the eligible employer receives their credit, which will be issued as a check.</p>

<br /><p>For businesses and organizations that utilize a large volume of managed print services, it’s a challenge to understand how to optimize costs.</p>
<br /><p>Between a lack of knowledge around how to analyze pricing information and how to consolidate vendor contracts, businesses everywhere are overpaying for managed print services.</p>
<br /><p>In order to understand where you’re overpaying and how to negotiate better rates, it takes expert-level knowledge in this industry. It also takes time and resources that many businesses simply don’t have.</p>
<br /><p>To gain a better understanding of how you can start saving costs on managed print services, let’s take a closer look at how these services are priced, why there are savings to be found, and how P3 Cost Analysts bring these savings to our clients.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>The managed print services industry generally comprises two types of units: printers and copiers.	Printers are the types of machines that generally reside in individual oﬃces or on desks. These machines can still be quite expensive, but they are smaller and intended mainly for individual use. Copiers, on the other hand, are the large, commercial-grade machines seen in a large oﬃce environment. These machines are shared between many users and can print hundreds of thousands of pages per month.</p>
<br /><p>In the managed print services industry, there are several major vendors. HP leads the way in regards to printers, holding around 90% of the market share. The other 10% of printers and the majority of the copier sector are controlled by Canon, Xerox, Ricoh, Konica Minolta, and Toshiba.</p>
<br /><p>When acquiring these machines and the services that accompany them, customers may work with these manufacturers directly, a regional dealer for the companies, or an independent managed print services company that represents those brands.</p>
<br /><p>As a highly competitive industry, these vendors are always looking to match or rise above the competition in regard to functionality and features. Because of this, there are very few distinguishing features between the brands, leading to a fairly level playing field for customers to choose from. Given that these machines are somewhat of a ‘commodity’ in nature, and since functionality and service are similar across the industry, the distinguishing factor for customers is cost difference.</p>
<br /><p>There are three main categories of costs when it comes to managed print services:</p>
<br /><p>Depending on the vendor, there will be variations in how these three categories are priced. It’s common for vendors to oﬀer a great rate in one category while elevating the price in another to reach their total desired price point. Typically, the customer will be attracted by the pricing in one category without understanding that they are being overcharged in the others.</p>
<br /><p>When selling managed print services, vendors also calculate a cost per page for their customers, which is a ratio between equipment/supply costs and the volume of pages produced. However, in most cases, the cost per page which is presented to customers does not factor in all the costs associated with the</p>
<br /><p>all-inclusive total cost per page. Without knowing what to look for or what to factor in when calculating this cost, it’s impossible to know if the rates are good or bad.</p>
<br /><p>For the average customer, the only information about pricing they receive is from the sales rep they work with. And in a lot of cases, these sales reps are given the price they can sell at without actually knowing the true costs of what they are selling. This lack of transparency within the industry as a whole leaves customers blind to know if there could be room to negotiate better rates.</p>
<br /><p>Even if the customer thinks they have a high degree of knowledge or are given the right information, it’s unlikely they will know how to analyze it properly. Furthermore, customers that may use an RFP process to gather pricing and proposals may get competing bids, but these bids are never optimized for the clients’ actual needed services or at true market rates. As a result of this, the print industry is rife with confusion and overcharges. This leads to the vast majority of customers being overcharged 30-40%. Without a nationwide database of vendor benchmarks and prior experience in the print industry, it’s impossible to know if what you are spending is accurate and cost-eﬃcient.</p>
<br /><p>A big issue for many businesses and organizations is that they have numerous machines under a variety of diﬀerent contracts. This creates ongoing problems, such as diﬀerent lease expiration dates and variations in pricing for products and services.</p>
<br /><p>When there are multiple diﬀerent price points on machines that are essentially the same, you are not only overpaying, but reconciling invoices also becomes a nightmare for your billing administrators.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>In almost any industry, when you buy or lease in bulk with a singular vendor, you get much better pricing on those products. The same goes for managed print services. A key mistake we see with businesses and organizations is having their buying power split between multiple contracts and multiple vendors.</p>
<br /><p>In order to optimize spending and have uniform rates across your spending, these contracts need to be consolidated under one vendor.</p>
<br /><p>For example</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a large, well-respected university that had 500 copiers on their campus under 500 diﬀerent contracts, and worked with 15 diﬀerent vendors. Because of their status as a well-known university, they thought they were getting the lowest rates possible, but that simply was not the case. They were shocked at their price savings once we were ﬁnished consolidating their contracts.</p>
<br /><p>With any business or organization we work with, we help them:</p>
<br /><p>All of this leads to cost savings and less hassle for the billing department to reconcile invoices.</p>
<br /><p>Unfortunately, optimizing and consolidating these agreements is no easy task. Vendor agreements in the print industry are notoriously tough. While addressing the varied nuances is outside the scope of this whitepaper, you cannot simply break a contract or renegotiate. There are countless hoops to jump through and roadblocks to overcome on the road to an optimized program.</p>
<br /><p>There are many variables when it comes to choosing the right lease duration, and comparing your options is extremely diﬃcult when you don’t know what to look for. At P3 Cost Analysts, we take on all that responsibility for our customers. With our industry expertise, we are able to conduct a proper comparison between vendors and their oﬀerings, leaving our customers with the best possible lease agreements and print programs.</p>
<br /><p>Customers can rest assured that we know what competitive pricing and well-structured print programs look like.</p>
<br /><p>Just as important as cost savings, you need to ensure that the level of service and print equipment the customers receive stays the same amidst contract negotiations. By working with us, all of our customers will get better service, better equipment, and all the cost savings on top of these.</p>
<br /><p>One thing that rarely gets communicated to customers is that they should get a certain number of technicians on their account based on their volume of pages produced. For example, an accepted industry benchmark is for every one million pages produced, that account needs to have one full-time service technician available to service that ﬂeet of machines. But, if you don’t know how to negotiate this benchmark, and if it’s not clearly outlined in your contract, you will almost certainly not get the service you need and deserve.</p>
<br /><p>For Example</p>
<br /><p>We worked with a large university on the West Coast that was producing 100 million pages per month, but they did not have any technicians assigned to their account prior to our involvement. We told them they were getting short-changed on service and we made sure to get the appropriate technician agreement into their new contract.</p>
<br /><p>Since we are aware of these benchmarks and know they should be in the contracts, we ensure that all of our customers have the proper service they deserve.</p>
<br /><p>Sometimes, with speciﬁc types of accounts, vendors have allotted marketing dollars available to help secure the deal. Vendors could use this money to sponsor the school football team, reduce the cost of their equipment or services, give away free toner, and many other things to attract customers. Many sales teams will also get a bonus when they can replace a competitor’s machine with their own.</p>
<br /><p>Vendors will deny this money exists and that it rarely gets passed on to customers. However, we know this money is available and we are able to leverage this knowledge to beneﬁt our customers. In many cases, we are able to get our customers around $100,000 in signing bonuses. They would never have gotten this money if they negotiated their contracts on their own because they would not have asked for it nor known how to get it included in the contract.</p>
<br /><p>Based on our experience, we can conﬁdently say we save customers a minimum of 30%-50% on managed print services, with our average savings being 38%.</p>
<br /><p>By leveraging our expertise and looking at the totality of all cost factors, we have a consistent process for ﬁnding savings for all of our customers.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>After the execution of our shared savings agreement, we gather invoices and contract information from clients on their managed print program. In this category, we are often able to obtain this information from the vendors directly, further saving the client time.</p>
<br /><p>During the audit phase, we do a thorough assessment of our client’s managed print programs. 	Applying decades of expertise in this industry, we review contracts, machines, volumes, and costs down to the penny. We run all client expenses against our database of vendor benchmarks to be sure our clients have best-in-class pricing.</p>
<br /><p>About 4-6 weeks after our initial meeting, we come back to the client with our ﬁndings and recommendations.</p>
<br /><p>Once our ﬁndings are approved, we work with the vendor to secure new agreements and set up the most cost-eﬃcient program.</p>
<br /><p>Once negotiations are complete, we implement our recommendations and then share in the cost savings with our clients.</p>
<br /><p>During this phase, we monitor our client's invoices each month to ensure savings stay intact and vendors honor the agreements and pricing. We have found vendors are constantly violating their own agreements and we monitor and ﬁght oﬀ unwarranted price increases and overcharges on our client's behalf. Furthermore, we monitor market conditions and look for ways to keep costs down or drive them lower.</p>
<br /><p> </p>
<br /><p>If you are a large business or organization with a high volume of managed print services, the only way you can effectively save on these costs is to hire someone in-house that has a tremendous amount of experience in the industry, or to outsource to professionals.</p>

<br /><p>Exploring the earnings of franchise owners often leads to the pivotal question: How much does a franchise owner make a year? This question, essential to anyone considering the leap into franchising, reveals a complex situation with few straight answers.</p>
<br /><p>To shed light on this topic, we’re diving into data from Franchise Business Review, Glassdoor, Zippia, and ZipRecruiter to assess how much franchisees make on average and the potential yearly earnings one can expect.</p>
<br /><p>By analyzing average incomes across various industries and markets, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of how much a franchise owner makes a year, guiding those interested in this path.</p>
<br /><p>The earning potential of franchise owners can vary widely, shaped by factors like industry, location, and individual business strategy, with reported salaries for franchise owners in the United States ranging from as low as $39,000 to as high as $204,800 annually. This range highlights the significant variability in income potential within the franchising world.</p>
<br /><p>Keep in mind these are just reported ranges of salaries. A franchise owner is a business owner, so they make money two different ways. One is by paying themselves a fair market salary for their services working for the company they own, and the second way they make money is if their business(a franchise in this case) makes a profit. If the franchise makes a profit, then the franchise owner makes money there as well.</p>
<br /><p>To better understand these differences, we’ve gathered data from various sources, providing a comprehensive overview of what franchise owners really earn across different contexts and scenarios.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review’s recent survey of nearly 30,000 franchisees offers valuable insights into the question, “How much do franchisees make?” The average annual income for franchise owners is reported at $107,119.</p>
<br /><p>Notably, franchise owners who have moved beyond the startup period, typically the first two years in business, see their average incomes increase to $118,792. This figure is significantly higher than the average salary of independent small business owners, which is $64,432 according to PayScale, showcasing a distinct advantage in the franchise model.</p>
<br /><p>The report also illustrates the impact of owning multiple franchise units. Franchisees operating a single unit report an average income of $90,200, while those with two to four units see their average annual incomes rise to $132,400. For franchise owners who expand their portfolio to five or more units, the average franchise owner salary escalates to an impressive $204,800.</p>
<br /><p>Glassdoor data sheds light on the earnings of franchise owners in the United States based on self-reported salary data. Their estimated total annual pay for a franchise owner is approximately $98,162. This information is based on Glassdoor’s proprietary Total Pay Estimate model, which draws from salaries reported by users plus extra pay, which can include bonuses, commissions, tips, and profit sharing. This extra pay can vary significantly depending on the specific pay models and profit-sharing structures of different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>The ‘Most Likely Range’ of total pay, falling within the 25th to 75th percentile of all reported data, spans from $74,000 to $137,000 annually. This detailed breakdown offers a realistic view of the average franchise owner salary, reflecting the varied compensation models across different franchises.</p>
<br /><p>According to Zippia, the average salary for a franchise owner in the United States is notably lower than other sources, at $49,588, with a typical range between $39,000 and $62,000 annually. Zippia further breaks down these figures by state, providing a regional perspective on franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>The lower figures reported by Zippia might be attributed to their data collection methodology, which includes a mix of employee self-reports, public internet data, and proprietary information from other companies. This blend of sources, while offering diverse insights, also introduces a potential for variance in accuracy, especially considering the self-reported nature of some data.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s state-by-state analysis of franchise owner salaries reveals that the national average salary is around $109,437, aligning more closely with other sources like Franchise Business Review. They provide a detailed regional breakdown, highlighting Minnesota as the top state with an average annual salary of $119,885 for franchise owners.</p>
<br /><p>ZipRecruiter’s methodology involves estimating compensation ranges for job listings where the employer does not state a pay range. This approach factors in the job title, location, and hiring company to generate their estimates.</p>
<br /><p>While these figures are based on a robust algorithm, it’s important for potential franchise owners to consider that these are estimates and may not completely align with the actual compensation range, which can fluctuate based on numerous factors.</p>
<br /><p>The Franchise Business Review report offers insight into the average salaries within various sectors, showcasing which industries may be the most profitable. Here’s a look at some key industries and their average franchise owner salaries.</p>
<br /><p>This sector includes companies that provide services to other businesses, such as consulting, marketing, and cost reduction services. These franchises often offer unique advantages, particularly in scalability and market demand. For instance, P3 Cost Analysts, a leader in cost reduction, combines strong market demand with a proven business model, making it an attractive option for those who want to work from home and scale without having to open multiple locations.</p>
<br /><p>Including a range of services like beauty, fitness, and cleaning, this industry caters directly to individual consumers. The high average salary reflects the consistent and growing consumer demand for personal services, driven by increasing disposable income and a focus on health and wellness.</p>
<br /><p>The senior care industry, significantly impacted by demographic trends such as an aging population, has seen a growing demand for elder care services. This sector includes a range of services like in-home care, nursing homes, senior living relocation services, and specialized healthcare. The high average salary in this industry reflects not only the essential nature of these services but also the expanding market as our population ages.</p>
<br /><p>The pet services industry, covering everything from grooming to pet daycare, capitalizes on the strong emotional bond people have with their pets. With increasing pet ownership and willingness to spend on pets, this industry has seen substantial growth, reflected in its attractive average salary.</p>
<br /><p>As you can see from the numbers above, the world of franchising offers a vast range of income potential. Due to this range, pinpointing an exact franchise owner salary can be challenging. However, there are several key factors that may determine how much franchise owners can earn.</p>
<br /><p>The geographic location of your franchise can significantly influence your earnings. Franchises situated in high-traffic areas or regions with a strong demand for your product or service tend to generate higher revenues and profits.</p>
<br /><p>The choice of industry can be a major driver of profitability. Some industries inherently yield higher profit margins than others, such as those listed above. For example, healthcare or specialized retail franchises may be harder to break into but often offer greater earning potential compared to highly competitive industries.</p>
<br /><p>Franchisees with prior industry-specific experience may find it easier to adapt and operate efficiently. Experience can lead to better decision-making, streamlined operations, and a quicker return on investment, all contributing to higher earnings.</p>
<br /><p>The level of support and training provided by the franchisor can directly impact profitability. Franchise systems that offer comprehensive training programs, ongoing assistance, and marketing support enable franchisees to navigate challenges effectively and drive revenue growth.</p>
<br /><p>The royalty structure established by the franchisor is a critical factor in determining earnings. Higher royalty rates may reduce a franchisee’s profitability, while those with reasonable royalty fees can retain a larger share of their earnings, contributing to a healthier owner income.</p>
<br /><p>The number of franchise locations you operate can significantly influence your earnings. Owning multiple franchise units within the same or different franchise brands can offer several advantages in terms of profitability.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding these factors is essential for making informed decisions and when considering the average franchise owner salary.</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Business Review stands out as potentially the most reliable source, having directly surveyed nearly 30,000 franchisees. However, it’s important to acknowledge that their data, like the others, is self-reported. This aspect underscores the need for a cautious approach in interpreting these figures, as self-reported data can be subject to biases and individual variances.</p>
<br /><p>The ranges of franchise owner salaries reported by these sources are quite broad, highlighting the variability in earnings across the franchise industry. This disparity can be attributed to several factors, including the franchise’s location, the specific industry, and the operational efficiency of each franchise. Such variability suggests that prospective franchise owners should consider a wide array of factors when evaluating potential earnings.</p>
<br /><p>Despite differences in the numbers between sources like Zippia and ZipRecruiter, there is a consistent trend where franchise owners in the Northeast, West Coast, and Midwest regions generally report higher salaries. This geographical trend is a crucial consideration for potential franchisees, as it indicates that location can significantly influence the financial success of a franchise.</p>
<br /><p>While these data sources provide valuable insights into the potential earnings of franchise owners, they should be viewed within the broader context of the franchise industry. Earnings can be influenced by the type of franchise, its geographic location, and the individual performance of franchise owners. This understanding is essential for potential franchise owners, emphasizing the need to consider these estimates as part of a comprehensive research process before making a decision.</p>
<br /><p>The financial compensation for franchise owners is quite different from regular salaried employment. A franchise owner’s income primarily comes from the profits of the business, which is the revenue left after all operating costs are covered. These costs include not just typical business expenses like staffing, supplies, and property maintenance but also specific franchise-related fees.</p>
<br /><p>For instance, franchisees must pay initial buy-in fees to acquire the franchise rights and ongoing royalties, which are often a percentage of the gross sales or a fixed fee. These royalties can significantly impact the overall profitability, as they are a recurring expense directly tied to the business’s revenue.</p>
<br /><p>In addition to managing these financial aspects, franchise owners are heavily involved in the day-to-day operations, which includes responsibilities like hiring and training staff, maintaining the property, and ensuring adherence to the franchisor’s standards. This hands-on management is crucial, especially in the initial years when the focus is on establishing the business and recovering the initial investment.</p>
<br /><p>It’s common for franchise owners not to see substantial personal income until the business becomes firmly established, which can take a couple of years. During this period, the franchise owner’s role is to ensure the stability and growth of the business, often putting their personal salary secondary to the needs of the franchise. This startup period can be minimized by proper research and planning when deciding on the most profitable franchise for you.</p>
<br /><p>Choosing the most profitable franchise requires careful consideration and thorough research. It’s not just about brand power but also understanding the finer details that contribute to long-term success. Here are key steps to guide you in this crucial decision-making process:</p>
<br /><p>Franchise Disclosure Documents (FDDs) are loaded with information important financial information about a franchise. They provide details on everything from the company’s legal and financial history to its operational requirements. Carefully comparing the FDDs of different franchises can reveal insights into their stability, growth potential, and potential owner income.</p>
<br /><p>Understanding the cost structure of a franchise is vital. Franchise fees and ongoing royalties can vary significantly and will impact your profitability. Assess these costs in relation to the value and support the franchisor provides.</p>
<br /><p>The success of a franchise heavily depends on its location and the market it serves. Investigate local market demands, competition, and economic conditions to determine the most favorable locations for your franchise.</p>
<br /><p>A realistic grasp of the operating expenses is crucial. This includes costs like rent, utilities, staffing, and inventory. Knowing these will help you calculate potential profit margins and manage cash flow effectively.</p>
<br /><p>The level of training and support a franchisor offers can greatly influence your success. Look for franchises that provide comprehensive training programs, marketing support, and ongoing assistance, as these can play a critical role in navigating challenges and driving growth.</p>
<br /><p>P3 Cost Analysts stands out as a highly attractive franchise opportunity, especially for those seeking a competitive franchise owner salary. Unlike other franchises that require multiple units for revenue growth, P3 can easily be scaled without additional locations.</p>

<br /><p>Exploring how much franchise owners make in a year, we’ve seen the influence of factors like industry, location, and franchisor support.
