   <h1>The Franchise Offering</h1>
If you are like many people working in corporate America, you have often wondered if you could break free and start your own business; be your own boss. Though many people consider becoming business owners, a significant number of them fail to take action on their ideas. Often this is due to not knowing what to do next; without a clear and structured process to follow it can be almost impossible to start when you don’t even know the path.

<h2>The Path to Follow</h2> 
 
If you are considering franchising, you already have some idea of the value of proven systems and processes. At P3, that doesn’t start when you become  a franchisee; we offer you a proven process to follow even as you are investigating the franchise.

<h2>Is P3 the Right Model for You?</h2> 
Of course there is no such thing as the perfect franchisee, or the perfect franchisor; we are all just looking for the perfect fit. Our mutual evaluation process is designed to provide you, and us, all the information we need to make an informed decision on if a franchise relationship makes sense.

<h2>The Initial Investment</h2> 
Part of making a decision on a franchise is understanding the investment. Not just what you pay the franchisor, but also the 'all-in' including things like working capital. Obviously you'll want to balance the investment against what you feel are the realistic returns; however sometimes the investment itself can be a threshold manner.
