   <h1>The Franchise Offering</h1>
If you are like many people working in corporate America, you have often wondered if you could break free and start your own business; be your own boss. Though many people consider becoming business owners, a significant number of them fail to take action on their ideas. Often this is due to not knowing what to do next; without a clear and structured process to follow it can be almost impossible to start when you don’t even know the path.

<h2>The Path to Follow</h2> 
 
If you are considering franchising, you already have know that proven systems and processes are a significant part of the franchise model; a path to follow. Often, however, you don't know the path to follow to <em>get to the starting line</em>. We recognize that, and have developed a clear path to follow as you are investigating the franchise. Our mutual evaluation process is designed to provide clear touch points and milestones as you work through the decision-making process.

<h2>Is P3 the Right Model for You?</h2> 
Of course there is no such thing as the perfect franchisee, or the perfect franchisor; we are all just looking for the perfect fit. Our mutual evaluation process is designed to provide you, and us, all the information we need to make an informed decision on if a franchise relationship makes sense.

<h2>The Initial Investment</h2> 
Part of making a decision on a franchise is understanding the investment. Not just what you pay the franchisor, but also the 'all-in' including things like working capital. Obviously you'll want to balance the investment against what you feel are the realistic returns; however sometimes the investment itself can be a threshold manner.

        <h2>Unique approach to Territory</h2> 
Your P3 Cost Analyst franchise will likely organically grow quickly outside your home area, and often clear across the country. Its only natural when you offer a service that <strong>saves small business owners money</strong> and <strong>is only paid for through a share of savings</strong> that your clients will refer you to other business owners they know, and these relationships are not confined by geographical boundaries. That requires P3 to take a unique approach to territorial protection.

<h2>Learn From the Do’ers </h2> 
As you investigate the franchise, you’ll have a chance to talk with existing franchisees, and hear their real lived experiences as P3 Cost Analysts business owners. They will share with you, among other things, what there experience with our various offerings, what its really like to run an executive business-to-business franchise model, and how they have seen our reoccurring revenue models play out in their own business.
