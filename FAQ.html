        <li>What Is The Royalty Fee?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>At P3 Cost Analysts, we've taken a unique approach to the traditional royalty fee model. Instead of charging a fixed percentage, we operate on a shared savings structure. Our clients pay only for the savings we generate for them, splitting the realized savings 50/50. Revenue is then split 60/40. You keep 40%, and we cover the cost of auditing, back office processing, invoicing, and more with the 60%. This model aligns our success with yours and with that of our clients, ensuring everyone benefits from the cost savings achieved. This innovative approach underscores our commitment to a model where the success of our clients directly translates to the success of our franchisees.</li>

    <h2>
        <li>How should I research a franchise?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Effective franchise research is systematic and thorough. Begin by exploring the franchisor's website for preliminary insights. The Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) is crucial, offering detailed insights into financial requirements, the franchisor's history, and legalities—essential for understanding the franchise's framework.< br/>But don't limit your research to documents. Engaging with current franchisees provides valuable, real-world insights into the franchise's operations and support. Their firsthand experiences can shed light on the practical aspects of running the franchise and their satisfaction levels.< br/>Additionally, franchise expos present a unique opportunity to connect directly with franchisors and gain a deeper understanding of the franchise community. This approach ensures you're evaluating the franchise from multiple perspectives, aligning with your entrepreneurial goals.</li>

    <h2>
        <li>Can I Sell A Franchise If I Decide To Get Out Of It?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Absolutely, selling your franchise is an option should you choose to pursue a different path. However, this process comes with its own set of guidelines and prerequisites designed to ensure a smooth transition. Key steps include securing the franchisor's nod of approval, pinpointing a buyer who's a perfect fit, and effectively transferring the franchise agreement to the new proprietor. Your franchise agreement is your go-to resource for the ins and outs of this process, detailing any specific procedures, possible limitations, or stipulations you need to be aware of. It’s crafted to guide you through the selling maze, ensuring you adhere to all necessary protocols and help facilitate a seamless handover.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <h2>
        <li>How Long Does It Take To Open A Franchise?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The time from signing a franchise agreement to opening your doors for business can be at times boring, fraught, frustrating, exhilarating, and sometimes that’s all in one day! Brick and mortar franchisees can take, on the low end, 2 - 3 months to find location, the same again for any required retrofitting, and another month or so for finalizing the interior look and feel of the location. For franchisees required to purchase real estate and build out the franchised location, time to open can be in excess of 3 years. Frankly, this is a reasonable amount of time, considering the expenses related to opening a brick and mortar location. Franchisees of home-based franchises, especially those in the B2B service space, generally don’t have these kinds of lead times. At P3 Cost Analysts as soon as you are training you are ready to open, and under 90 days from franchise agreement to engaging with clients is completely realistic.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <h2>
        <li>If I Buy A Franchise, Am I Really An Independent Business?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yes, if you buy a franchise, you are considered an independent business owner. However, it is important to note that you will be operating under the guidelines and systems set forth by the franchisor. This means that while you have the freedom to run your business, you will still need to follow certain rules and regulations established by the franchise. This can include things like using approved suppliers, adhering to brand standards, and paying ongoing royalties or fees to the franchisor. Overall, owning a franchise offers a balance of independence and support from an established brand.</li>
