Keep in mind that this investment doesn't include personal cash reserves. Like any business, a P3 Cost Analysts business takes time to grow. Unlike traditional brick and mortar, you wouldn't be running a high 'burn rate', but you do want to be able to launch your business and establish the network and connections necessary to be successful without stressing about keeping the lights on at home.
